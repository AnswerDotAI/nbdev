<project title="nbdev">nbdev makes exploration an integral part of your workflow, all while promoting software engineering best practices. It allows you to write, test, document, and distribute software packages and technical articles — all in one place, your notebook.

Here are some of nbdev's features:

- **Supports literate programming**: write prose, code, and tests in notebooks — no context-switching
- **Git-friendly notebooks**: human-readable merge conflicts; no unwanted metadata
- **Two-way sync between notebooks and plaintext source code**: allows you to use your IDE for code navigation or quick edits
- **Beautiful technical documentation**: documentation is automatically generated using Quarto and hosted on GitHub Pages; docs support LaTeX, are searchable, and are automatically hyperlinked (including out-of-the-box support for many packages via nbdev-index)
- **Seamless testing**: write tests as ordinary notebook cells, run them in parallel with a single command; out-of-the-box continuous integration with GitHub Actions to ensure tests pass before every merge
- **Simplified package release**: publish packages to PyPI and conda; Python best practices are automatically followed (e.g. only exported objects are included in `__all__`)<tutorials><doc title="Getting started"># Getting Started

## 🛑**Jan 2026 Major Version Update – Breaking Change**🛑

**nbdev3 is here!** As many of you have been requesting, configuration
has moved from `settings.ini` to `pyproject.toml`, following modern
Python packaging standards ([PEP
621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)). Your project metadata now
lives in the standard `[project]` section, while nbdev-specific settings
go in `[tool.nbdev]`.

**Migrating from nbdev2:** Run `nbdev-migrate-config` in your project
root to automatically convert your `settings.ini` to `pyproject.toml`
and update your GitHub Actions workflows to use nbdev3-compatible
versions. Your existing notebooks and code don’t need any changes.

`nbdev` is a notebook-driven development platform. Simply write
notebooks with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation,
tests, continuous integration, and packaging for free!

`nbdev` makes debugging and refactoring your code much easier than in
traditional programming environments since you always have live objects
at your fingertips. `nbdev` also promotes software engineering best
practices because tests and documentation are first class.

- **Documentation** is automatically generated using
  [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted on [GitHub
  Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Docs support LaTeX, are searchable,
  and are automatically hyperlinked (including out-of-the-box support
  for many packages via
  [`nbdev-index`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-index))
- **Publish packages to PyPI and conda** as well as tools to simplify
  package releases. Python best practices are automatically followed,
  for example, only exported objects are included in `__all__`
- **Two-way sync between notebooks and plaintext source code** allowing
  you to use your IDE for code navigation or quick edits. Sync is
  robust: each exported cell is tagged with its unique notebook cell ID,
  so `nbdev-update` always updates the correct cell
- **Tests** written as ordinary notebook cells are run in parallel with
  a single command
- **Continuous integration** out-of-the-box with [GitHub
  Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that run your tests and
  rebuild your docs
- **Git-friendly notebooks** with [Jupyter/Git
  hooks](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/git_friendly_jupyter.html) that
  clean unwanted metadata and render merge conflicts in a human-readable
  format
- … and much more!

## Install

nbdev works on macOS, Linux, and most Unix-style operating systems. It
works on Windows under WSL, but not under cmd or Powershell.

You can install nbdev with pip:

``` sh
pip install nbdev
```

Note that `nbdev` must be installed into the same Python environment
that you use for both Jupyter and your project.

## How to use nbdev

The best way to learn how to use nbdev is to complete either the
[written walkthrough](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) or
video walkthrough:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7zS8Ld4_iA" target="_blank"
title="nbdev walkthrough"><img
src="https://github.com/fastai/logos/raw/main/nbdev_walkthrough.png"
style="border-radius: 10px" width="560" height="315" /></a>

Alternatively, there’s a [shortened version of the video
walkthrough](https://youtu.be/67FdzLSt4aA) with coding sections sped up
using the `unsilence` Python library – it’s 27 minutes faster, but a bit
harder to follow.

## FAQ

### Q: What is the warning “Found a cell containing mix of imports and computations. Please use separate cells”?

A: You should not have cells that are not exported, *and* contain a mix
of `import` statements along with other code. For instance, don’t do
this in a single cell:

``` python
import some_module
some_module.something()
```

Instead, split this into two cells, one which does `import some_module`,
and the other which does `some_module.something()`.

The reason for this is that when we create your documentation website,
we ensure that all of the signatures for functions you document are up
to date, by running the imports, exported cells, and
[`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc) functions
in your notebooks. When you mix imports with other code, that other code
will be run too, which can cause errors (or at least slowdowns) when
creating your website.

### Q: Why is nbdev asking for root access? How do I install Quarto without root access?

A: When you setup your first project, nbdev will attempt to
automatically download and install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for
you. This is the program that we use to create your documentation
website.

Quarto’s standard installation process requires root access, and nbdev
will therefore ask for your root password during installation. For most
people, this will work fine and everything will be handled automatically
– if so, you can skip over the rest of this section, which talks about
installing without root access.

If you need to install Quarto without root access on Linux, first `cd`
to wherever you want to store it, then [download
Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), and type:

``` bash
dpkg -x quarto*.deb .
mv opt/quarto ./
rmdir opt
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s "$(pwd)"/quarto/bin/quarto ~/.local/bin
```

To use this non-root version of Quarto, you’ll need `~/.local/bin` in
your [`PATH` environment
variable](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/).
(Alternatively, change the `ln -s` step to place the symlink somewhere
else in your path.)

### Q: Someone told me not to use notebooks for “serious” software development!

A: [Watch this video](https://youtu.be/9Q6sLbz37gk). Don’t worry, we
still get this too, despite having used `nbdev` for a wide range of
“very serious” software projects over the last three years, including
[deep learning libraries](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), [API
clients](https://github.com/fastai/ghapi), [Python language
extensions](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore), [terminal user
interfaces](https://github.com/nat/ghtop), and more!

The written tutorial below shows you how to create a Python package from
scratch using nbdev.

Alternatively, you can watch this video tutorial where Jeremy Howard and
Hamel Husain guide you through a similar process step by step:

</iframe>

</div>

## Installation

You’ll need the following software to complete the tutorial, read on for
specific installation instructions:

1.  Python
2.  A Python package manager: we recommend conda or pip
3.  Jupyter Notebook
4.  nbdev
5.  Quarto

If you haven’t worked with Python before, we recommend getting started
with the [Anaconda Individual
Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and using the
conda package manager.

Note that you will only need to follow the steps in the installation
section once per environment. If you create a new repo, you won’t need
to redo these.

### Install JupyterLab

Launch a terminal and install JupyterLab by entering:

``` sh
conda install -c conda-forge -y jupyterlab
```

…or

``` sh
pip install jupyterlab
```

…if you’re using the pip package manager.

You can now launch Jupyter by entering:

``` sh
jupyter lab
```

This should open JupyterLab in a new browser tab:

<img src="images/jupyter-welcome.png" data-fig-align="center" />

### Install nbdev

The next step is to install nbdev itself. JupyterLab comes with its own
terminal, so we’ll use that moving forward.

In the Launcher, scroll down to the “Other” section, then click
“Terminal”. If the Launcher isn’t opened, you can open it by clicking
“File” → “New Launcher”.

A new tab should open with a blank terminal – it might not look exactly
the same, depending on how your shell is configured:

<img src="images/jupyter-blank-terminal.png" data-fig-align="center" />

For Mac and Linux, enter:

``` sh
conda install -c fastai -y nbdev
```

…or for Mac, Linux and Windows:

``` sh
pip install nbdev
```

…if you’re using pip.

### Install Quarto

nbdev provides a command to install the latest version of Quarto. In the
terminal, enter:

``` sh
nbdev-install-quarto
```

Your password may be requested at this point. Since nbdev is open
source, you can read [the source
code](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/blob/master/nbdev/quarto.py) of
this command to verify that it isn’t doing anything malicious. Or, if
you prefer, you may instead follow [Quarto’s official installation
instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

### Install Quarto JupyterLab extension

Quarto provides its own [JupyterLab
extension](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab-extension.html)
that allows it to render Quarto markdown content.

For example, here is their notebook demonstrating some of its features:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/261654/230087634-d5027ebc-8508-43b4-81c9-c4b7d6cfa738.png)

Install the extension by entering:

``` sh
pip install jupyterlab-quarto
```

Note that the `jupyterlab-quarto` package is not currently available via
conda.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You’re all setup and ready to go! Installing these tools may take some
time, but you’ll only need to do it once. Next, we’ll setup an nbdev
repo for your specific project.

## First steps

By the end of this section you’ll have your own nbdev repo with tests,
continuous integration, streamlined PyPI & conda packaging, and a
documentation website.

### Create an empty GitHub repo

Create an empty GitHub repo using the convenient link
[github.com/new](https://github.com/new). If you get stuck, you might
find GitHub’s [*Create a
repo*](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)
page helpful.

Remember to add a description, since nbdev will use that later. Don’t
add a README file, .gitignore, or license just yet.

If you’re using the web interface, it should look something like this
(with your own repository name and description) before you click “Create
Repository”:

<img src="images/github-create-new-repo.png"
class="p-2 pb-3 border rounded shadow-sm" data-fig-align="center"
width="600" />

You should then be redirected to your new repo:

<img src="images/github-repo-empty.png"
class="pb-2 border rounded shadow-sm" data-fig-align="center" />

<div>

> **Try GitHub’s powerful CLI**
>
> GitHub’s web interface is a great way to get started. As you grow more
> experienced, you might want to explore [the GitHub
> CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) (command line interface). We often
> prefer to use command line tools for repetitive tasks where we’re
> likely to make mistakes. Having those tasks written as small scripts
> in your terminal means that you can repeat them with little effort.

</div>

### Initialise your repo with nbdev

Now clone your repo from the Jupyter terminal you started
[earlier](#install-nbdev) (or create a new terminal following those
instructions if needed). If you get stuck here, you might find GitHub’s
[*Cloning a
repository*](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
page helpful.

Since we created a repo named `nbev-hello-world` with the `fastai` user,
we can clone it as follows:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-hello-world.git
```

Then `cd` (change directory) to our repo:

``` sh
cd nbdev-hello-world
```

You may have seen this message while cloning:

    You appear to have cloned an empty repository.

…since the repo is completely empty. Let’s add some files!

nbdev provides the `nbdev-new` command to initialise an empty git
repository. It’ll infer information about your project from git and
GitHub, and ask you to input anything remaining. It will create files in
your repo that:

- Streamline publishing Python packages to PyPI and conda.
- Configure Quarto for publication-grade technical documentation.
- Setup GitHub actions to test notebooks and build and deploy Quarto
  docs to GitHub pages.

Initialise your nbdev repo by entering:

``` sh
nbdev-new
```

It may ask you to enter information that it couldn’t infer from git or
GitHub.

<div>

> **Note**
>
> `nbdev-new` assumes that your package name is the same as your repo
> name (with `-` replaced by `_`). Use the `--lib_name` option if that
> isn’t the case.

</div>

Double-check your `pyproject.toml` file to ensure that it has all of the
correct information. Then commit and push your additions to GitHub:

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m'Initial commit'
git push
```

### Enable GitHub Pages

nbdev hosts your docs on GitHub Pages—an excellent (and free!) way to
host websites.

<div>

> **Note**
>
> nbdev uses GitHub Pages by default because its easily accessible.
> However, you can use any host you like. See [these
> docs](../explanations/docs.ipynb#deploying-your-docs-on-other-platforms)
> for more information.

</div>

You need to enable GitHub Pages for your repo by clicking on the
“Settings” tab near the top-right of your repo page, then “Pages” on the
left, then setting the “Branch” to “gh-pages”, and finally clicking
“Save”.

It should look similar to this after you click “Save”:

<img src="images/github-enable-pages.png"
class="pb-2 border rounded shadow-sm" data-fig-align="center" />

If you don’t see a “gh-pages” branch, wait a few minutes and reload the
page. It should automatically be set up for you.

Now it’s time to see all of the goodies nbdev gives you!

### Check out your workflows

Open GitHub Actions by clicking the “Actions” tab near the top of your
repo page. You should see two workflow runs:

<img src="images/github-actions-initial.png"
class="border rounded shadow-sm" data-fig-align="center" />

If you opened this page shortly after pushing your initial commit, the
runs may not have a green check (✅) because they’re still “In progress”
or “Queued”. That’s no problem, they shouldn’t take much more than a
minute to complete.

If you see a red cross (❌), that means something failed. Click on the
cross, then click “Details”, and you’ll be able to see what failed. If
you can’t figure out what’s wrong, search [the
forum](https://forums.fast.ai/c/nbdev/48) in case someone else resolved
the same issue, otherwise create a new post describing your issue in as
much detail as you can, and we’ll try our best to help you. Remember
that including a link to an actual repo and/or GitHub Action is the best
way for us to quickly identify what’s wrong.

What do these workflows do?

- **CI** – The CI (continuous integration) workflow streamlines your
  developer workflow, particularly with multiple collaborators. Every
  time you push to GitHub, it ensures that:
  - Your notebooks and libraries are in sync
  - Your notebooks are cleaned of unwanted metadata (which pollute pull
    requests and git histories and lead to merge conflicts)
  - Your notebook tests all pass
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages** – Builds your docs with Quarto and deploys
  it to GitHub Pages.

We provide these basic workflows out-of-the-box, however, you can edit
their corresponding YAML files in the `.github/workflows/` folder to
your liking.

### Check out your docs

When you [enable GitHub Pages](#enable-github-pages) you should see a
new workflow run: “pages build and deployment”. As the name suggests,
this workflow deploys your website contents to GitHub Pages.

<img src="images/github-actions-pages.png"
class="border rounded shadow-sm" data-fig-align="center" />

Wait for the workflow run to complete, then open your website. By
default it should be available at: `https://{user}.github.io/{repo}`.
For example, you can view `fastai`’s `nbdev-hello-world` docs at
<https://fastai.github.io/nbdev-hello-world>.

<img src="images/nbdev-hello-world-site-initial.png"
class="border rounded shadow-sm" data-fig-align="center" />

### Recap

You now have a base nbdev repo with continuous integration and hosted
documentation! Here’s a recap of the steps you took:

- Created a GitHub repo (with GitHub Pages enabled)
- Initialised your repo with `nbdev-new`
- Pushed to GitHub.

## Make your first edit

In this section, you’ll make your first edit to the repo you created in
[*First steps*](#first-steps).

### Install hooks for git-friendly notebooks

Step one when working with Jupyter notebooks in a new repo is to install
nbdev’s hooks (you can think of “hooks” as plugins or extensions to an
application).

Install them by entering this command in your terminal:

``` sh
nbdev-install-hooks
```

<div>

> **Note**
>
> The [clean hook](#nbdev_clean-on-saving-notebooks-in-jupyter)
> currently only supports Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. If you’re
> using VSCode, you can try the [experimental nbdev VSCode
> extension](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-vscode). Otherwise, you
> might also want to try [nbdev’s pre-commit
> hooks](../tutorials/pre_commit.ipynb).

</div>

See [*Git-friendly Jupyter*](git_friendly_jupyter.html) for more about
how nbdev hooks work and how to customise them. Here’s a short summary:

- Fix broken notebooks due to git merge conflicts so that they can be
  opened and resolved directly in Jupyter.
- Each time you save a Jupyter notebook, automatically clean unwanted
  metadata to remove unnecessary changes in pull requests and reduce the
  chance of git merge conflicts.
- Automatically trust notebooks in the repo so that you can view widgets
  from collaborators’ commits. For this reason, **you should not install
  hooks into a repo you don’t trust**.

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> nbdev’s git hooks work on *any* git repo, even if it doesn’t use the
> broader nbdev system.

</div>

### Build your library

You should now create your package from your notebook by running:

``` sh
nbdev-export
```

This will create Python modules for your notebooks. These modules will
make up the contents of your Python package.

### Install your package

You might have noticed that `nbdev-new` created a Python package in your
repo. In our case, it was automatically named `nbdev_hello_world` by
using our repo name `nbdev-hello-world` and replacing `-` with `_` to
make it a valid Python package.

The next step is to install your package by entering this into your
terminal:

``` sh
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

This is the recommended way to make a Python package importable from
anywhere in your current environment:

- `-e` – short for “editable”, lets you immediately use changes made to
  your package without having to reinstall, which is convenient for
  development.
- `.` – refers to the current directory.
- `[dev]` – includes “development” requirements: other packages that
  your notebooks use solely for documentation or testing.

### Preview your docs

nbdev is an interactive programming environment that values fast
feedback loops. The `nbdev-preview` command helps achieve this by using
Quarto to render your docs on your computer and keep them updated as
your edit your notebooks.

Start the preview by entering this into your terminal:

``` sh
nbdev-preview
```

It may say `Preparing to preview` for a few seconds while it gets
started, and will eventually display something like:

    Watching files for changes
    Browse at http://localhost:3000/

Click the link to open the preview in a new browser tab. It should look
exactly like your online docs.

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> We often find it useful to keep a preview window open on the side
> while we’re editing our notebooks in Jupyter.

</div>

### Edit 00_core.ipynb

Now, open the `nbs/00_core.ipynb` file (generated by running `nbdev-new`
earlier) in Jupyter. You don’t *have* to start your notebook names with
a number, but we find it helpful to show the order that your project
should be read in – even though it could have been created in a
different order.

#### Add your own frontmatter

You’ll see something that looks a bit like this:

<div class="py-2 px-3 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm" fig-align="center">

**core**

> Fill in a module description here

``` python
#| default_exp core
```

</div>

Let’s explain what these special cells means:

- The first is a markdown cell with nbdev’s markdown *frontmatter*
  syntax that defines notebook metadata used by Quarto, our
  documentation engine (see the
  [frontmatter](../api/09_frontmatter.ipynb) reference page for more).
  It contains:
  - H1 header (“core”) – defining the page title
  - Quote (“Fill in a module description here”) – defining the page
    description
- The second is a code cell with a *directive* `default_exp` which
  decides which module this notebook will export to (see the
  [Directives](../explanations/directives.ipynb) explanation for more).
  Currently, it exports to the `core` module.

Next, rename the notebook, replace the title and description, and change
the default export module for your own project.

Once you’re done, save the notebook. The live preview started in the
previous section should update with your latest changes.

Rerun all cells in your notebook to ensure that they work, and to export
the updated modules.

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> We find the “restart kernel and run all cells” Jupyter command (the ⏩
> button) so invaluable that we bind it to a keyboard shortcut. A common
> criticism of notebooks is that out-of-order execution leads to
> irreproducible notebooks. In our experience, making “restart and
> rerun” a habit solves this problem.

</div>

Running the notebook exports Python modules because of the last cell
which contains:

``` python
#| hide
import nbdev; nbdev.nbdev_export()
```

What does this mean?

- `#| hide` is a directive (like `#| default_exp`) which excludes a cell
  from both your exported module and docs
- `nbdev-export` is the command used to export your notebooks to Python
  modules.

We recommend including a cell like this at the bottom of all of the
notebooks you want to export.

<div>

> **Warning**
>
> Remember to delete any unused modules that aren’t exported by a
> notebook or otherwise needed by your package. This is likely to happen
> if you change the default export of a notebook – nbdev doesn’t remove
> the old module. This is intended, since nbdev is designed to work with
> hybrid packages that use .py modules (with no corresponding notebook)
> as well as those exported from notebooks.

</div>

#### Add your own function

Add a new code cell below the `#| default_exp` cell with a function. For
example:

``` python
#| export
def say_hello(to):
    "Say hello to somebody"
    return f'Hello {to}!'
```

Notice how it includes `#| export` at the top – this is a directive
(like `#| default_exp`) that tells nbdev to include the cell in your
exported module and in your documentation.

The documentation should look like this:

<div class="py-2 px-3 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm">

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### say_hello

>  say_hello (to)

Say hello to somebody

</div>

#### Add your own examples, tests, and docs

One of the superpowers of notebook-driven development is that you can
very easily add examples, tests, and documentation right below your
code.

Include regular code cells, and they’ll appear (with output) in your
docs, for example:

``` python
say_hello("Isaac")
```

    'Hello Isaac!'

This is a test too! When you run `nbdev-test` it will execute this cell
(and all other test cells) and fail if they raise any exceptions.

For tests, it’s preferred to use more explicit `assert`s:

``` python
assert say_hello("Hamel") == "Hello Hamel!"
```

…or functions from
[`fastcore.test`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html), which behave like
`assert` but also display the actual and expected values if they differ:

``` python
from fastcore.test import *
```

``` python
test_eq(say_hello("Hamel"), "Hello Hamel!")
```

Another superpower of notebook-driven development is that your examples
can include plots, images, and even JavaScript widgets. For example,
here’s an SVG circle:

``` python
from IPython.display import display,SVG
```

``` python
display(SVG('<svg height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40"/></svg>'))
```

### Prepare your changes

Before commiting your changes to GitHub we recommend running
`nbdev-prepare` in the terminal, which bundles the following commands:

- `nbdev-export`: Builds the `.py` modules from Jupyter notebooks
- `nbdev-test`: Tests your notebooks
- `nbdev-clean`: Cleans your notebooks to get rid of extreanous output
  for git
- `nbdev-readme`: Updates your repo’s `README.md` file from your index
  notebook.

### Edit index.ipynb

Now you’re ready to personalize your documentation home page and
`README.md` file; these are both generated automatically from
index.ipynb. Open Jupyter, then click on `nbs/index.ipynb` to open it.

We recommend including a longer description about what your package
does, how to install it, and how to use it (with a few examples which
import and use your package). Remember, examples can be code cells with
real outputs rather than plain markdown text – they’ll double as tests
too!

### Push to Github

You can now commit and push your changes to GitHub. As we mentioned
before, always remember to run `nbdev-prepare` before you commit to
ensure your modules are exported and your tests pass. You can use
`git status` to check which files have been generated or changed. Then:

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m 'Add `say_hello`; update index' # Update this text with your own message
git push
```

This will kick-off your GitHub Actions. Wait a minute or two for those
to complete, then check your updated repo and documentation.

### Recap

Congratulations, you’ve used all of the basics needed to build
delightful projects with nbdev! Here’s a recap of the steps you took:

- Installed hooks for git-friendly notebooks with `nbdev-install-hooks`
- Installed your package with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`
- Previewed your docs with `nbdev-preview`
- Added your own frontmatter, function, tests, and docs to
  `nbs/00_core.ipynb`
- Prepared your changes with `nbdev-prepare`
- Updated `nbs/index.ipynb` with your own information
- Pushed to GitHub.

Read on to learn about more advanced nbdev functionality. Also see our
[explanations](../explanations) for deep-dives on specific topics, as
well as our other [tutorials](../tutorials).

## Advanced functionality

### Add a class

Create a class in `00_core.ipynb` as follows:

``` python
#| export
class HelloSayer:
    "Say hello to `to` using `say_hello`"
    def __init__(self, to): self.to = to
        
    def say(self):
        "Do the saying"
        return say_hello(self.to)
```

This will automatically appear in the docs like this:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HelloSayer

``` python

def HelloSayer(
    to
):

```

*Say hello to `to` using `say_hello`*

#### Document with show_doc

However, methods aren’t automatically documented. To add method docs,
use [`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc):

``` python
show_doc(HelloSayer.say)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HelloSayer.say

``` python

def say(
    
):

```

*Do the saying*

And add some examples and/or tests:

``` python
o = HelloSayer("Alexis")
o.say()
```

    'Hello Alexis!'

### Add links with backticks

Notice above there is a link from our new class documentation to our
function. That’s because we used backticks in the docstring:

``` python
    "Say hello to `to` using `say_hello`"
```

These are automatically converted to hyperlinks wherever possible. For
instance, here are hyperlinks to `HelloSayer` and `say_hello` created
using backticks.

### Set up autoreload

Since you’ll be often updating your modules from one notebook, and using
them in another, it’s helpful if your notebook automatically reads in
the new modules as soon as the Python file changes. To make this happen,
just add these lines to the top of your notebook:

    %load_ext autoreload
    %autoreload 2

### Set up prerequisites

If your module requires other modules as dependencies, you can add those
prerequisites to `[project].dependencies` in your `pyproject.toml`.

For example if your module requires the `fastcore` module of at least
version 1.0.5, the `torchvision` module of at most version 0.7 and any
version of `matplotlib`:

``` toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "fastcore>=1.0.5",
    "torchvision<0.7",
    "matplotlib",
]
```

You can also add optional dependencies using
`[project.optional-dependencies]`. For more information about the format
of dependencies, see the [pyproject.toml
specification](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/).

### Set up console scripts

Behind the scenes, nbdev uses that standard package `setuptools` for
handling installation of modules. One very useful feature of
`setuptools` is that it can automatically create [cross-platform console
scripts](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point).
nbdev surfaces this functionality; to use it, use the same format as
`setuptools`, with whitespace between each script definition (if you
have more than one).

    console_scripts = nbdev_export=nbdev.cli:nbdev_export

### Upload to pypi

If you want people to be able to install your project by just typing
`pip install your-project` then you need to upload it to
[pypi](https://pypi.org/). The good news is, we’ve already created a
fully pypi compliant installer for your project! So all you need to do
is register at pypi (click “Register” on pypi) if you haven’t previously
done so, generate an API token (go to [Account
settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/) and click “Add API token”)
and then create a file called `~/.pypirc` with your token details. It
should have these contents:

    [pypi]
    username = __token__
    password = your_pypi_token

Another thing you will need is `twine`, so you should run once

    pip install twine

To upload your project to pypi, just type `nbdev-pypi` in your project
root directory. Once it’s complete, a link to your project on pypi is
displayed.

### Upload to conda

Similar to `pip install` support, we have provided an anaconda compliant
installer to upload your project to [anaconda](https://anaconda.org).
Once uploaded, your package can be installed by typing
`conda install -c your_anaconda_username your-project`.

You need to register at anaconda (fill out the form to `Sign Up`) which
will create a username and password. You will then need to install the
following packages

    pip install anaconda-client conda-build conda-verify

Before running the anaconda uploader, you need to login to conda using
the CLI command (you will be prompted to enter your username and
password)

    anaconda login

To upload to anaconda, just type `nbdev-conda` in your project root
directory.

### Upload to pypi and conda

The command `nbdev-release-both` from the root of your nbdev repo will
upload your project to both conda and pypi.

### Install collapsible headings and toc2

There are two jupyter notebook extensions that I highly recommend when
working with projects like this. They are:

- [Collapsible
  headings](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/collapsible_headings/readme.html):
  This lets you fold and unfold each section in your notebook, based on
  its markdown headings. You can also hit <kbd>left</kbd> to go to the
  start of a section, and <kbd>right</kbd> to go to the end
- [TOC2](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html):
  This adds a table of contents to your notebooks, which you can
  navigate either with the `Navigate` menu item it adds to your
  notebooks, or the TOC sidebar it adds. These can be modified and/or
  hidden using its settings.

### Math equation support

nbdev supports equations (using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). You can
include math in your notebook’s documentation using the following
methods.

Using `$$`, e.g.:

    \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i

Which is rendered as:

> \_{i=1}^{k+1}i

Using `$`, e.g.:

    This version is displayed inline: \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}i . You can include text before and after.

Which is rendered as:

> This version is displayed inline: \_{i=1}^{k+1}i . You can include
> text before and after.

For more information, see [the Quarto
Docs](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html)

### Look at nbdev “source” for more ideas

Don’t forget that nbdev itself is written in nbdev! It’s a good place to
look to see how fast.ai uses it in practice, and get a few tips. You’ll
find the nbdev notebooks here in the [nbs
folder](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/tree/master/nbs) on Github.

### Quarto Features

nbdev supports most Quarto features. We encourage you to read the
[Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) to discover all the features
available to you. For example you can [incorporate
Graphviz](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html#graphviz).

It is worth taking a look at the documentation for
[figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html),
[callouts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html),
[markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html),
[widgets](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/widgets/jupyter.html),
[layouts](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/layout.html), [conditional
content](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/conditional.html) and [quarto
extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) to name a few useful
things we have encountered.</doc><doc title="Best practices"># Notebook Best Practices



The flexibility offered by notebooks can be overwhelming. While there
are industry standards for writing Python packages—like
[numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard)
and
[sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)
docstrings, and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and
[unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) testing
frameworks—they weren’t designed for notebooks.

This article walks you through the practices we’ve learned to leverage
the full power of notebooks with nbdev[1]. Our approach weaves code,
tests, and docs into a single interactive context that invites
experimentation. If you prefer to learn by example, you might want to
start with [the annotated
example](#putting-it-all-together-an-annotated-example) and branch out
from there.

</figure>

## Know which form of notebook you’re writing

First of all, decide which form of notebook you’re writing. We’re fans
of the [Diátaxis system](https://diataxis.fr/) which classifies
documentation into four forms: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations,
and references. They’ve laid this out beautifully in the following
diagram:

<a href="/images/divio-overview.webp"><img src="../images/divio-overview.webp" class="rounded"
alt="A 2x2 matrix, from top-left to bottom-right, &#39;Tutorials (learning-oriented)&#39;, &#39;How-to guides (problem-oriented)&#39;, &#39;Explanation (understanding-oriented), and &#39;Reference (information-oriented)&#39;. Horizontal axis reads &#39;Most useful when we&#39;re studying&#39; on the left, and &#39;Most useful when we&#39;re working&#39; on the right. Vertical axis reads &#39;Practical steps&#39; on top, and &#39;Theoretical knowledge&#39; below." /></a>

## Start with a great title and subtitle

Start with a markdown cell at the top of your notebook with its title in
an H1 header, and subtitle in a blockquote. For example:

``` markdown
# Great title

> And an even better subtitle
```

The title will also be used to reference your page in the sidebar. You
can also optionally add [frontmatter](../api/09_frontmatter.ipynb) to
this cell to customize nbdev and Quarto.

## Introduce your notebook

Introduce your notebook with markdown cells below the title. We
recommend a slightly different approach depending on the [form of
documentation](#know-which-form-of-notebook-youre-writing):

- **Reference:** Start with a brief description of the technical
  component, and an overview that links to the main symbols in the page
  (you might want to [use
  doclinks](#reference-related-symbols-with-doclinks))
- **Tutorials and how-to guides:** Describe what the reader will learn
  and how. Keep it short and get to the subject matter quickly
- **Explanations:** Since these are typically very focused, a short
  description of the topic is often sufficient.

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> Note that Markdown lists such as the one above require a blank line
> above them to be rendered as lists in the documentation, even though
> the notebook viewer will render lists that are not preceded by a blank
> line.

</div>

## Use lots of code examples, pictures, plots, and videos

Take advantage of the richness of notebooks by including code examples,
pictures, plots, and videos.

Here are a few examples to get you started:

- fastai’s documentation makes extensive use of code examples, plots,
  images, and tables, for example, the [computer vision
  intro](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.vision.html)
- [`nbdev.release`](../api/18_release.ipynb) opens with a terminal
  screencast demo in SVG format created with
  [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) and
  [svg-term-cli](https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term-cli)
- The [documentation explanation](../explanations/docs.ipynb#overview)
  describes a complex data pipeline using a [Mermaid
  diagram](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html)
- The [directives explanation](../explanations/directives.ipynb)
  showcases all of nbdev’s directives with executable examples in
  call-out cards (and makes great use of emojis too!)
- [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Cookbook.html#drawing-molecules-jupyter)
  renders beautiful molecule diagrams

## Keep docstrings short; elaborate in separate cells

While nbdev renders docstrings as markdown, they aren’t rendered
correctly when using `symbol?` or `help(symbol)` and they can’t include
executed code. By splitting longer docstrings across separate code and
markdown cells you can [use code examples, pictures, plots, and
videos](#use-lots-of-code-examples-pictures-plots-and-videos).

We find a single-line summary sufficient for most docstrings.

## Document parameters with docments

[`fastcore.docments`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/docments.html) is a
concise way to document parameters that is beautifully rendered by
nbdev. For example, this function:

``` python
def draw_n(n:int, # Number of cards to draw
           replace:bool=True # Draw with replacement?
          )->list: # List of cards
    "Draw `n` cards."
```

…would include the following table as part of its documentation:

<div class="py-2 px-3 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm">

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Default</strong></th>
<th><strong>Details</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>n</td>
<td>int</td>
<td></td>
<td>Number of cards to draw</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>replace</td>
<td>bool</td>
<td>True</td>
<td>Draw with replacement?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Returns</strong></td>
<td><strong>list</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td><strong>List of cards</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

nbdev also supports some numpy docstring sections. For example, this
code snippet would produce the same table (there’s no need to include
types like in the docstring if you already have annotations):

``` python
def draw_n(n:int, replace:bool=True) -> Cards:
    """
    Draw `n` cards.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    n
        Number of cards to draw
    replace
        Draw with replacement?
        
    Returns
    -------
    cards
        List of cards
    """
```

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> You can render a symbol’s parameters table directly with `DocmentTbl`.
> In fact, that’s how we rendered the table above.

</div>

## Make code cells short, and demonstrate them immediately

In notebooks, do not create long functions and classes with comments
interspersed throughout them. Instead, split your code up into small
separate cells with explanations and working examples after each. This
lets the user understand how each part works and experiment with them
straight away. It also helps you during development because you can
explore the behavior of every part of your code interactively.

In non-notebook coding, the documentation, tests, code, and examples are
all separate. This is not the case with nbdev. Take advantage of this by
keeping all of these things as close together as possible. This is
helpful both for exploration and for documentation.

For example, consider the section of the Claudette source notebook for
[implementing image
support](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#images). The section
immediately imports an image and displays it, showing how to work with a
file format. It then creates a number of helper functions, describes and
demonstrates them, and finally puts it all together to show how to use
the complete feature in practice with real inputs and outputs running
directly in the notebook.

In order to avoid long class definitions caused by many methods,
consider using fastcore’s `patch` decorator to implement each method
separately, and immediately document, demonstrate, and test it.

## Consider turning code examples into tests by adding assertions

nbdev blurs the lines between code, docs, and tests. *Every* code cell
is run as a test (unless it’s explicitly marked otherwise), and any
error in the cell fails the test.

Consider turning your code examples into tests by adding assertions – if
they would make valuable tests and if it doesn’t hurt readability.
[`fastcore.test`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html) provides a set of
light wrappers around `assert` for better notebook tests (for example,
they print both objects on error if they differ).

Here’s an example using
[`fastcore.test.test_eq`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html#test_eq):

``` python
def inc(x): return x + 1
test_eq(inc(3), 4)
```

## Document error-cases as tests

Docstring-driven approaches typically document the errors raised by an
object using plaintext descriptions, for example, in a “raises” section.

In nbdev, we recommend documenting errors with actual failing code using
[`fastcore.test.test_fail`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html#test_fail).
For example:

``` python
def divide(x, y): return x / y
test_fail(lambda: divide(1, 0), contains="division by zero")
```

The first argument is a `lambda` since we need to allow `test_fail` to
control its execution and catch any errors.

## Reference related symbols with doclinks

If you surround a symbol with backticks, nbdev will automatically link
to that symbol’s reference page. We call these
[doclinks](../api/05_doclinks.ipynb).

Prefer fully qualified symbol paths, like `package.module.symbol`
instead of `symbol`. It may be more verbose but it helps users know
which module a symbol originates from, which is especially important for
third-party packages.

Any package created with nbdev will automatically support doclinks.
Non-nbdev packages can be supported by creating a minimal nbdev-index
package. [`nbdev-index`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-index) is a
collection of such packages, which already supports django, numpy,
pandas, pytorch, scipy, sphinx, the Python standard library, and even
other programming languages like APL!

## Add rich representations to your classes

This is another way to take advantage of the [rich display feature of
notebooks](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html#rich-display).
You can provide rich representations to your object by defining a
`_repr_markdown_` method that returns markdown text (which may also
include HTML/CSS).

Here’s a simple example to get you started:

``` python
class Color:
    def __init__(self, color): self.color = color
    def _repr_markdown_(self):
        style = f'background-color: {self.color}; width: 50px; height: 50px; margin: 10px'
        return f'<div style="{style}"></div>'
```

``` python
Color('green')
```

<div style="background-color: green; width: 50px; height: 50px; margin: 10px">

</div>

``` python
Color('blue')
```

<div style="background-color: blue; width: 50px; height: 50px; margin: 10px">

</div>

Also see [the earlier list of example
projects](#use-lots-of-code-examples-pictures-plots-and-videos) that
make use of beautiful visual representations.

## Document class methods with [`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc) or [`fastcore.basics.patch`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#patch)

nbdev automatically documents exported function and class definitions
with [`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc).
However, it’s up to you to document class methods. There are two ways to
do that: calling
[`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc) on the
method, or defining the method with the
[`fastcore.basics.patch`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#patch)
decorator.

<div class="panel-tabset">

### Notebook (show_doc)

If your class is defined in a single cell, use
[`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc). Here’s
what your notebook might look like:

<div class="pt-4 pb-1 px-3 mb-2 border rounded shadow-sm">

``` python
#| export
class Number:
    "A number."
    def __init__(self, num): self.num = num
    def __add__(self, other):
        "Sum of this and `other`."
        return Number(self.num + other.num)
    def __repr__(self): return f'Number({self.num})'
```

For example, here is the number 5:

``` python
Number(5)
```

``` python
show_doc(Number.__add__)
```

For example:

``` python
Number(3) + Number(4)
```

</div>

### Notebook (@patch)

If you split your class definition across cells with
[`fastcore.basics.patch`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#patch),
here’s what your notebook might look like:

<div class="pt-4 pb-1 px-3 mb-2 border rounded shadow-sm">

``` python
#| export
class Number:
    "A number."
    def __init__(self, num): self.num = num
    def __repr__(self): return f'Number({self.num})'
```

For example, here is the number 5:

``` python
Number(5)
```

``` python
#| export
@patch
def __add__(self:Number, other):
    "Sum of this and `other`."
    return Number(self.num + other.num)
```

For example:

``` python
Number(3) + Number(4)
```

</div>

### Docs

In either case, this is how the documentation would be rendered:

<div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Number

>  Number (num)

A number.

For example, here is the number 5:

``` python
Number(5)
```

    Number(5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Number.\_\_add\_\_

>  Number.__add__ (other)

Sum of this and `other`.

For example:

``` python
Number(3) + Number(4)
```

    Number(7)

</div>

</div>

## Group symbols with H2 sections

As your notebooks grow, consider grouping related symbols using markdown
cells with level 2 headers. Since nbdev displays documented symbols as
level 3 headers, this would group all symbols below your level 2 header.

Here is the markdown syntax:

``` markdown
## Section title
```

## Split long explanations with H4 sections

Similar to the previous section, as a symbol’s explanation grows,
consider grouping its cells using level 4 headers. This is the
recommended way to structure your reference docs, for example, to
achieve numpy-style structures with sections like notes, examples,
methods, and so on.

Here’s the markdown syntax:

``` markdown
#### Section title
```

## Putting it all together: an annotated example

In this section, we’ll guide you through a full example of writing a
documented and tested function in a notebook using all of the principles
described above. We’ll use the
[`numpy.all`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.all.html#numpy.all)
function since it follows the widely-known numpy-docstring standard for
.py files.

Below is the definition of the
[`numpy.all`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.all.html#numpy.all)
function. Take note of how all of the information is included in the
docstring. While this works well for .py files, it doesn’t let us weave
executable code with rich markdown as we can in notebooks:

``` python
def all(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=np._NoValue, *, where=np._NoValue):
    """
    Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True.
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which a logical AND reduction is performed.
        The default (``axis=None``) is to perform a logical AND over all
        the dimensions of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in
        which case it counts from the last to the first axis.
        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
        If this is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple
        axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.
        It must have the same shape as the expected output and its
        type is preserved (e.g., if ``dtype(out)`` is float, the result
        will consist of 0.0's and 1.0's). See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more
        details.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.
        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `all` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in checking for all `True` values.
        See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.
        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0
    Returns
    -------
    all : ndarray, bool
        A new boolean or array is returned unless `out` is specified,
        in which case a reference to `out` is returned.

    --------
    ndarray.all : equivalent method
    any : Test whether any element along a given axis evaluates to True.
    Notes
    -----
    Not a Number (NaN), positive infinity and negative infinity
    evaluate to `True` because these are not equal to zero.

```

Alternatively, Here is how we’d write
[`numpy.all`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.all.html#numpy.all)
in a notebook using nbdev. The first step is to define the function:

<div class="column-screen-inset-right">

``` python
#| export
def all(a, # Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
        axis:int|tuple|None=None, # Axis or axes along which a logical AND reduction is performed (default: all).
        out:np.ndarray|None=None, # Alternate output array in which to place the result.
        keepdims:bool=np._NoValue, # Leave reduced one-dimensional axes in the result?
        where=np._NoValue, # Elements to include in reduction. See `numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details. New in version 1.20.0.
        ) -> np.ndarray|bool: # A new boolean or array, or a reference to `out` if its specified.
    "Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to `True`."
    ...
```

</div>

We can observe the following differences between this code and
numpy-docstrings:

- The definition uses simple type annotations, which will be rendered in
  the function’s parameters table below
- Parameters are described with a short comment, called
  [docments](#document-parameters-with-docments) – a concise alternative
  to numpy and sphinx docstring formats (although nbdev does support
  numpy docstrings see [this
  example](#document-parameters-with-docments))
- The docstring and parameter descriptions are all short, single-line
  summaries. We prefer to [keep docstrings short and instead elaborate
  in separate
  cells](#keep-docstrings-short-elaborate-in-separate-cells), where we
  can use markdown and real code examples.

Note: the use of `|` syntax for unions e.g. `int|tuple|None` (equivalent
to `Union[int, tuple, None]`) requires using Python 3.10 or by treating
all annotations as strings using `from __future__ import annotations`
which is available from Python 3.7.

Our function definition is automatically rendered in the docs like this.
Note that parameter names, types, defaults, and details are all parsed
from the definition which means you don’t have to repeat yourself.

<div class="pt-2 pb-1 px-3 mt-2 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm overflow-auto">

</div>

Next, describe how to use your function using markdown cells and [lots
of code examples](#use-lots-of-code-examples-pictures-plots-and-videos).
This is the biggest benefit to developing in notebooks: instead of
copying and pasting code examples into plaintext, you can include real
executeable code examples.

We start with basic usage first:

<div class="pt-3 pb-1 px-3 mt-2 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm">

For example:

``` python
x = [[True,False],[True,True]]
test_eq(np.all(x), False)
```

</div>

Our code examples [use assertion functions from
`fastcore.test`](#consider-turning-code-examples-into-tests-by-adding-assertions),
so that they serve as both docs and tests. `nbdev-test` runs every code
cell as a test (unless it’s explicitly marked otherwise), and any error
in the cell fails the test.

Having described basic usage, we now elaborate on more advanced
functionality for each parameter. This differs from numpy’s approach
which includes all parameter docs in the table and where not all
parameters have code examples.

<div class="pt-3 pb-1 px-3 mt-2 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm">

With `axis`:

``` python
test_eq(np.all(x, axis=0), [True,False])
```

`axis` may be negative, in which case it counts from the last to the
first axis:

``` python
test_eq(np.all(x, axis=-1), [False,True])
```

If `axis` is a tuple of ints, a reduction is performed on multiple axes,
instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.

``` python
test_eq(np.all(x, axis=(0,1)), False)
```

Integers, floats, not a number (nan), and infinity all evaluate to
`True` because they’re not equal to zero:

``` python
test_eq(np.all([-1, 1, -1.0, 1.0, np.nan, np.inf, -np.inf]), True)
```

You can use `where` to test specific elements. For example, this tests
only the second column:

``` python
test_eq(np.all(x, where=[[False],[True]]), True)
```

The output can be stored in an optional `out` array. If provided, a
reference to `out` will be returned:

``` python
o = np.array(False)
z = np.all([-1, 4, 5], out=o)
test_is(z, o)
test_eq(z, True)
```

`out` must have the same shape as the expected output and its type is
preserved (e.g., if `dtype(out)` is float, the result will consist of
0.0’s and 1.0’s). See [Output type
determination](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.ufuncs.html#ufuncs-output-type)
for more details.

With `keepdims`, the result will broadcast correctly against the input
array.

``` python
test_eq(np.all(x, axis=0, keepdims=True), [[True, False]]) # Note the nested list
```

If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be passed
through to the `all` method of sub-classes of `ndarray`, however any
non-default value will be. If the sub-class’ method does not implement
`keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

``` python
class MyArray(np.ndarray):
    def all(self, axis=None, out=None): ...

y = MyArray((2,2))
y[:] = x
np.all(y) # No TypeError since `keepdims` isn't passed
test_fail(lambda: np.all(y, keepdims=True), contains="all() got an unexpected keyword argument 'keepdims'")
```

</div>

Since we prefer to document via code examples, we also document
error-cases with assertions using
[`fastcore.test.test_fail`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html#test_fail).
This differs from docstring-based approaches which usually document
error-cases in prose, usually in a “raises” section of the docstring.

Finally, we link to related symbols with
[doclinks](#reference-related-symbols-with-doclinks) (symbols surrounded
in backticks are automatically linked) and describe their relation using
code examples.

<div class="pt-3 pb-1 px-3 mt-2 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm">

The
[`numpy.ndarray.all`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.all.html#numpy.ndarray.all)
method is equivalent to calling
[`numpy.all`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.all.html#numpy.all)
with the array:

``` python
test_eq(np.array(x).all(), np.all(x))
```

In contrast,
[`numpy.any`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.any.html#numpy.any)
tests whether *any* element evaluates to `True` (rather than *all*
elements):

``` python
test_eq(np.any(x), True)
```

</div>

### Recap

In summary, here is how the nbdev version of
[`numpy.all`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.all.html#numpy.all)
differs from the numpy docstring. nbdev uses:

- Type annotations and docments instead of the numpy docstring format
  (although nbdev supports numpy docstrings too)
- Short parameter descriptions, with details in separate cells with
  markdown and code example
- Doclinks to related symbols instead of a “See also” section
- Lots of code examples (which are also tests) mixed with prose to
  describe how to use the function
- Code examples with assertions to document error-cases instead of a
  “Raises” section.

</doc></api><optional><doc title="Git-Friendly Jupyter" desc="How to use nbdev hooks for git-friendly Jupyter notebooks"># Git-Friendly Jupyter



Version control is essential to developing software, yet Jupyter
notebooks don’t work with version control by default. nbdev solves this
problem! It provides a set of hooks which enable git-friendly Jupyter
notebooks in any git repo, including those that don’t use the broader
nbdev system.

To get started, install nbdev:

<div class="panel-tabset">

#### pip

``` sh
pip install -U nbdev
```

#### conda

``` sh
conda install -c fastai nbdev
```

</div>

then install hooks:

``` sh
nbdev-install-hooks
```

That’s it! Read on if you’re stuck or if you’d like to learn more about
nbdev hooks and how to customise them. Check out [our related blog
post](https://www.fast.ai/2022/08/25/jupyter-git/) if you’re curious
about how this feature was developed and how it works under the hood.

<div>

> **Note**
>
> The [clean hook](#nbdev_clean-on-saving-notebooks-in-jupyter)
> currently only supports Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab. If you’re
> using another notebook editor, like VSCode or PyCharm, you might want
> to use [nbdev’s pre-commit hooks](../tutorials/pre_commit.ipynb).

</div>

## Quickstart: Install nbdev hooks for a repo

To start with, change directory to your current project and
double-check. Don’t worry about the strange path, that’s because we’re
using a temporary directory for this tutorial:

``` sh
pwd
```

    /private/var/folders/ft/0gnvc3ts5jz4ddqtttp6tjvm0000gn/T/tmpez8nec5v/repo

Install nbdev:

``` sh
pip install -Uqq nbdev
```

Install nbdev hooks:

``` sh
nbdev-install-hooks
```

    Not in a git repository, git hooks cannot be installed.

You’ll see the above error if you’re not in a git repo. If so,
initialise a git repository:

``` sh
git init
```

    Initialized empty Git repository in /private/var/folders/ft/0gnvc3ts5jz4ddqtttp6tjvm0000gn/T/tmpez8nec5v/repo/.git/

Then try installing nbdev hooks again:

``` sh
nbdev-install-hooks
```

    Hooks are installed.

If you already have a pre-save hook set in your Jupyter config file we
won’t be able to safely install a new one automatically. Instead, you’ll
encounter an error and will need to follow its instructions for a manual
installation.

Jupyter hooks will now be installed in your user’s Jupyter config
directory, and will work for all repos by default. Git hooks will only
be installed in the current repo; **you will need to rerun
`nbdev-install-hooks` for each of your git repos**. See [configuring
nbdev hooks](#configuring-nbdev-hooks) if you’d like to customise hook
behaviour, for example, to opt out of hooks in certain repos.

## What are nbdev hooks?

nbdev provides three hooks to ease Jupyter-git integration.

### [`nbdev_merge`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/merge.html#nbdev_merge) on merging notebooks with git

One of the biggest complaints when working with Jupyter is that merge
conflicts break notebooks. This is particularly problematic in projects
with many collaborators.

<figure>
<img src="images/jupyter-unreadable-notebook.png"
class="p-1 border rounded shadow-sm"
data-fig-alt="Jupyter notebook error: &#39;Error loading notebook: Unreadable Notebook...&#39;"
data-fig-align="center" width="800"
alt="Jupyter notebook shows the above error when opening a notebook with merge conflicts." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Jupyter notebook shows the above error
when opening a notebook with merge conflicts.</figcaption>
</figure>

Oftentimes these conflicts are on metadata like cell execution counts
that we don’t really care about. nbdev comes with a custom git merge
driver that automatically fixes conflicting outputs and metadata, and
that leaves remaining conflicts in a state that still works with
Jupyter. It works in all git commands that use merge under the hood,
including `merge`, `pull`, `rebase`, and `stash`.

Here’s what the conflict looks like in Jupyter with nbdev’s merge
driver:

<img src="images/jupyter-friendly-conflict.png"
class="p-2 border rounded shadow-sm"
data-fig-alt="Jupyter-friendly git conflict with patches in individual cells separated by conflict markers"
data-fig-align="center" width="400" />

### [`nbdev_clean`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/clean.html#nbdev_clean) on saving notebooks in Jupyter

Jupyter notebooks store a variety of metadata (including execution
counts and notebook extension info) that aren’t conducive to
collaborative version control systems like git. These pollute diffs in
pull requests and git histories (which can make debugging harder), and
tend to cause merge conflicts. For example:

``` diff
  {
   "cell_type": "code",
-  "execution_count": 1,
+  "execution_count": 2,
   "metadata": {
     "hide_input": false
  }
```

Python’s default repr is another example, since it includes a memory
address which we usually aren’t interested in:

``` diff
-<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fbc11508950>
+<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fbc113dbe90>
```

nbdev install a Jupyter hook which runs `nbdev-clean` to automatically
clean unwanted metadata and outputs from your notebooks, including ids
from default Python reprs! With nbdev hooks, the examples above would
become:

``` json
{
  "cell_type": "code",
  "execution_count": null,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

and

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot>

### [`nbdev_trust`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/clean.html#nbdev_trust) after merging notebooks with git

A side-effect of Jupyter’s security model is that widgets don’t work in
collaborative repos, unless you manually “trust” notebooks after each
`git pull`. There is a good reason behind this: since Jupyter notebooks
contain HTML and JavaScript, the trust system avoids running malicious
code when you open a notebook and don’t explicitly run any cells. See
[the official
documentation](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/security.html#security-in-notebook-documents)
for more.

Manually trusting notebooks each time is a pain. A more natural workflow
would be trust a repo once-off, and all notebooks and changes
thereafter. nbdev includes a git post-merge hook which runs
`nbdev-trust` in your repo to do exactly this.

## Configuring nbdev hooks

The most up-to-date reference of nbdev’s settings is in the
`nbdev-create-config` docs. In addition, this section will guide you
through a few common configurations.

**Control whether Jupyter hooks are run:**

- Globally enable Jupyter hooks: set `jupyter_hooks = true` in user
  settings (`~/.config/nbdev/config.toml`)
- Globally disable Jupyter hooks: set `jupyter_hooks = false` in user
  settings
- Enable Jupyter hooks only for selected repos: set
  `jupyter_hooks = false` in user settings and `jupyter_hooks = true` in
  the repo’s `[tool.nbdev]` in `pyproject.toml`

**Customise notebook cleaning with the following settings:**

- Clean *all* outputs and metadata: `clear_all`
- Preserve certain metadata by key: `allowed_metadata_keys` and
  `allowed_cell_metadata_keys`
- Clean `id`s from default Python `repr`s: `clean_ids`

All of the above can be customised per-user and per-repo.

**Control whether git hooks are run:**

Since git hooks are installed per-repo they’ll only run in repos where
you manually `nbdev-install-hooks`. If you change your mind later, you
can uninstall git hooks by following the instructions in the
`.gitconfig` file created in your repo.</doc><doc title="Blogging"><!DOCTYPE html>

We provide hooks for the [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/)
to catch and fix uncleaned and unexported notebooks, locally, without
having to wait for continuous integration pipelines to run.

They might also be useful as an alternative to the [Jupyter clean
hook](../tutorials/git_friendly_jupyter.ipynb#nbdev_clean-on-saving-notebooks-in-jupyter)
if you’re using a notebook editor that isn’t yet supported
(e.g. VSCode).

## Install pre-commit

…Install pre-commit (check [their latest
instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#install) if you have any
difficulty with these commands):

<div class="panel-tabset">

#### pip

``` sh
pip install pre-commit
```

#### conda

``` sh
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
```

#### homebrew (macOS)

``` sh
brew install pre-commit
```

</div>

## Configure pre-commit for your repo

Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your repo,
with the following contents:

``` yaml
repos:
- repo: https://github.com/fastai/nbdev
  rev: 2.2.10
  hooks:
  - id: nbdev-clean
  - id: nbdev-export
```

Include only the hook(s) you’d like to run, as well as any other
[supported hooks](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html).

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> If you expect all collaborators to use pre-commit, add the
> `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to your repo. Otherwise, add it to your
> `.gitignore`.

</div>

Install pre-commit hooks into your repo:

``` sh
pre-commit install
```

## Make a commit and enjoy pre-commit in action

When you do a `git commit` in a repo that has pre-commit hooks
installed, your new workflow will be as follows:

1.  pre-commit runs each hook on your *staged* changes (as in, changes
    that you `git add`ed)
2.  If a hook changes files – for example, if a commited notebook wasn’t
    cleaned – pre-commit stops the commit, leaving those changes as
    *unstaged*
3.  You can now stage those changes and make any edits required to get
    pre-commit to pass
4.  Redo the `git commit`, and if it succeeds, your commit will be
    created.

Using it in practice isn’t as complicated as it might sound. The best
way to figure out if it works for you is to give it a try.

## How to override pre-commit if you get stuck

If you struggle to get pre-commit to pass a commit that you absolutely
think is correct, you can [temporarily disable a
hook](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks) like this:

``` sh
SKIP=hook git commit
```

…where `hook` refers to a valid hook in your configuration, for example,
to disable the `nbdev-export` hook:

``` sh
SKIP=nbdev-export git commit
```

You can also disable pre-commit entirely with the `--no-verify` flag:

``` sh
git commit --no-verify
```

Finally, if you decide it’s not for you, you can completely remove
pre-commit hooks from your repo with:

``` sh
pre-commit uninstall
```</doc><doc title="Documentation Only Sites" desc="How to create nbdev powered docs without a library!"># Documentation Only Sites



## Background

While nbdev is great for authoring software, you may wish to utilize the
power of nbdev for the purposes of documenting existing code, or **use
various utilities of nbdev without having to write a python library**.
For example, you can use the following features of nbdev without
creating a python package:

- Custom [nbdev directives](../explanations/directives.ipynb) such as
  [`#| hide_line`](../explanations/directives.ipynb#hide_line).
- Testing with `nbdev-test`.
- Automated entity linking with
  [doclinks](best_practices.ipynb#reference-related-symbols-with-doclinks).
- Rendering API documentation with [docments and
  show_doc](best_practices.ipynb#document-parameters-with-docments).

## Setup

To setup a documentation only site, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create a nbdev repo the usual way, using `nbdev-new`
2.  Remove library files

``` bash
rm setup.py .github/workflows/test.yaml nbs/00_core.ipynb
```

3.  Remove your library folder (this will be the `lib_path` field in
    `[tool.nbdev]` in `pyproject.toml`):

``` bash
rm -rf <lib_path>
```

## Usage

After setting up your project, you can use various nbdev utilities per
usual:

- `nbdev-preview` for previewing your site
- `nbdev-test` for testing your docs locally
- Custom [nbdev directives](../explanations/directives.ipynb) will be
  available to you (but you must be careful not to use irrelevant ones
  like `#| export`).
- If you created your nbdev docs site on GitHub, GitHub Actions will
  publish your docs for you automatically [as described
  here](../explanations/docs.ipynb#Deploying-Docs-With-GitHub-Actions).
- You can publish your docs on other platforms as described
  [here](../explanations/docs.ipynb#Deploying-Your-Docs-On-Other-Platforms).

## Demo

A minimal example of a documentation-only site is located
[here](https://github.com/hamelsmu/nolib_nbdev).</doc><doc title="Modular nbdev" desc="How to use nbdev’s various tools separately"># Modular nbdev



While `nbdev-new` gets you started with everything you need to create a
delightful Python package, **you can also use each of nbdev’s components
listed below on their own**. You might find this useful if you’re
porting a large system over to nbdev, documenting an existing code base,
or if you’d like to customize the nbdev workflow for your own project.
Note that all of the commands below work without a `pyproject.toml` file
unless otherwise noted.

## Document existing code: [`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc)

nbdev allows you to document existing code, even code that is not
written in nbdev!
[`nbdev.showdoc.show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc)
allows you to render beautiful API documentation in notebooks and on
Quarto sites. For example, you can render API documentation for
[`numpy.all`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.all.html#numpy.all)
like this:

<div class="py-2 px-3 mb-4 border rounded shadow-sm" fig-align="center">

``` python
from nbdev.showdoc import show_doc
from numpy import all
show_doc(all)
```

## Testing notebooks: `nbdev-test`

Testing notebooks can be very useful outside of nbdev, especially if you
are documenting an existing code base and want to incorporate tests for
your docs. The `nbdev-test` CLI utility allows you to accomplish this:

You can test an individual notebook with the terminal command:

``` sh
nbdev-test --path notebook.ipynb
```

…or a folder of notebooks:

``` sh
nbdev-test --path tests/
```

## Export code to modules: [`nb_export`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/export.html#nb_export)

You can export a notebook to a module with the Python function:

``` python
nb_export('notebook.ipynb', 'pkg')
```

…provided the notebook specifies a `default_exp` directive at the top,
and `export` directives above each cell to be exported. We recommend
including this in a code cell at the bottom of your notebook for
convenience.

## Jupyter-git integration

Jupyter and Git don’t normally play well together, especially for things
like merge conflicts. We have outlined all of these problems, and our
solutions in [this blog
post](../blog/posts/2022-08-25-jupyter-git/index.qmd). You can install
our merge driver and hooks with the following command:

``` bash
nbdev-install-hooks
```

We describe what `nbdev-install-hooks` does in detail on [this
page](git_friendly_jupyter.ipynb).

You can also directly use any of its underlying commands, for example,
to implement your own hooks or extensions:

- `nbdev-clean`
- `nbdev-fix`
- `nbdev-merge`
- `nbdev-trust`

To configure your own hooks, Check out the [pre-commit hooks
tutorial](../tutorials/pre_commit.ipynb).

## Python packaging

`nbdev.release`provides utlities for easy packaging on PyPI, conda, and
GitHub. Check out the [`nbdev.release`](../api/release.html) docs for
more information. Note that this functionality requires a
`pyproject.toml` with `[tool.nbdev]`.</doc><doc title="Writing nbdev plugins" desc="How to customize nbdev processors to do what you want"># Writing nbdev plugins



## Export processors

The [`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor)
class shown later is for **doc processors** — they transform notebooks
when building documentation with `nbdev-docs`.

First though we’ll discuss the simpler kind of processor: **export
processors** — they transform code cells when exporting to `.py` files
with `nbdev-export`. These are just plain functions, not classes.

### Built-in export processor: `scrub_magics`

nbdev includes one export processor out of the box: `scrub_magics`. It
removes Jupyter magic lines (like `%%time`, `%matplotlib inline`,
`%%spark`) from your exported `.py` files.

To enable it, add to your `pyproject.toml`:

``` toml
[tool.nbdev]
export_procs = ["nbdev.scrubmagics:scrub_magics"]
```

For example, a cell like this:

``` python
%%time
#| export
def my_func(): return 42
```

Will export without the `%%time` line.

### Writing an export processor

An export processor is a function that receives a notebook cell and
modifies it in place:

``` python
def my_export_proc(cell):
    "Transform code cells during export"
    if cell.cell_type != 'code': return
    # Modify cell.source as needed
    cell.source = transform(cell.source)
```

For example, here’s a formatter using `black`:

``` python
# nbdev_black/__init__.py
def black_format(cell):
    "Format code cells with black"
    if cell.cell_type != 'code': return
    try:
        import black
        cell.source = black.format_str(cell.source, mode=black.Mode())
    except: pass  # Leave malformed code unchanged
```

### Enabling export processors

Add `export_procs` to your `pyproject.toml`:

``` toml
[tool.nbdev]
export_procs = ["nbdev_black:black_format"]
```

You can chain multiple processors — they run in order:

``` toml
[tool.nbdev]
export_procs = [
    "nbdev_black:black_format",
    "my_project.procs:my_custom_proc",
]
```

## Doc processors

### What will this cover?

With `nbdev`, it’s possible to customize and extend it further beyond
the standard capabilities through a well thoughtout and scalable
framework. Does your particular library or need require you to inject
custom quarto additives in certain cells? What about if you want to do
something more trivial such as finding shortcuts to replace complicated
quarto directives more easily (such as replacing `::: {.column-margin}`
with `#| margin`)?

Writing custom plugins with `nbdev` is the easiest method to achieve
this, and with this tutorial we will bring you up to speed on how you
can use this to create your own plugins to expand and simplify your
literate-programming experience with `nbdev` and quarto.

Specifically, we will be building a *processor* (something that
processes a notebook cell) that will let us quickly write out any
quarto-specific headers (that `::: {.some_annotation}`) and replace it
with a [`div`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/qmd.html#div) shortcut. This is
of course one example very specific to quarto that happens when building
the documentation, but this technique can be used to have custom
behaviors occur during library exportation as well.

> Note: We are using [`div`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/qmd.html#div)
> here is it more closely resembles how each of the related Quarto
> directives do and behave as they act like `<div>`s in HTML code

This tutorial *won’t* cover some of the basics when it comes to nbdev,
and instead comes with the understanding you know how to navigate nbdev
(such as what are
[directives](https://nbdev.fast.ai/explanations/directives.html),
[`export`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/explanations/directives.html#export-some.thing),
etc).

### Getting started, how does `nbdev` make this easy?

First let’s visualize just what we’re trying to achieve.

Instead of doing the following code which will add `"Some text"` to the
sidebar (as shown off to the side currently):

<div class="column-margin">

Some text

</div>

    ::: {.column-margin}
    Some text
    :::

We will create a shorter way to write this out, making use of how nbdev
and quarto writes their *directives*

By the end of this tutorial we will create something that looks like the
following:

    #| div column-margin

    Some text

And this will include cases where a
[`div`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/qmd.html#div) should be put across
*multiple* cells as well, by specifying a `start` and an `end`.

> Note: Check out the [article
> layout](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html) Quarto
> documentation to find the best examples of use cases for this custom
> directive, including the
> [`column-margin`](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#margin-content)
> just shown

This can be achieved in under 50 lines of code!

`nbdev` let’s us create what are called *processors* (this is how
`#| export` will shove code into modules, for example). These processors
are acted on each **cell** of a notebook and can modify its contents.
These can then be wrapped into a module the same way that nbdev will do
`nbdev-export` or `nbdev-docs`. Thanks to the power of writing custom
`nbdev` extensions, going deep into the inner-workings of the framework
isn’t required!

### Bringing in what we need

The actual imports we need to use from `nbdev` is truly not that many!
We just need two: -
[`extract_directives`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#extract_directives),
to read in the list of `#|` written - The
[`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor) class
that will actually perform what we want on notebook cells.

The rest of the imports are there to make some of our lives easier as
will be explained later

``` python
from nbdev.process import extract_directives
from nbdev.processors import Processor

from fastcore.basics import listify

from string import Template
```

Lastly for *testing* purposes we’ll utilize `nbdev`’s `mk_cell` function
and the
[`NBProcessor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#nbprocessor)
class, which will let us mock running our processor on a “real”
notebook!

``` python
from nbdev.processors import mk_cell, NBProcessor
```

### Writing a converter

The first step is creating a quick and easy way to take the `nbdev`
directive we want to use (such as `#| div column-margin`) and convert it
quickly into something quarto will then read (such as
`::: {.column-margin}`).

We can create a string `Template` to perform this for us:

``` python
_LAYOUT_STR = Template("::: {.$layout}\n${content}\n")
```

<div>

> **Tip**
>
> This doesn’t have to be a string template, I just found this the
> easiest to use!

</div>

``` python
_LAYOUT_STR.substitute(
    layout="column-margin",
    content="Some text to go on the sidebar"
)
```

    '::: {.column-margin}\nSome text to go on the sidebar\n'

Next we need to write a simple converter that operates at the *cell*
level:

``` python
def convert_layout(
    cell:dict, # A single cell from a Jupyter Notebook
    is_multicell=False # Whether the div should be wrapped around multiple cells
):
    "Takes a code cell that contains `div` in the directives and modifies the contents to the proper Quarto format"
    content = cell.source
    code = cell.source.splitlines(True)
    div_ = cell.directives_["div"]
    # We check if end is in the first line of the cell source
    if "end" in div_:
        # If it is, just fill the text with `:::` if no code exists there
        cell.source = ":::" if len(code) == 1 else f'{code.source}:::'
    else:
        # Actually modify the code
        cell.source = _LAYOUT_STR.substitute(layout=" ".join(div_), content=content)
        if not is_multicell: cell.source += ":::"
```

Let’s go into detail on what’s happening here.

``` python
    content = cell.source
```

The source text of whatever exists in a notebook cell will live in
`.source`.

``` python
    code = cell.source.splitlines(True)
```

Then I want to extract the content of the cell and split them into
multiple lines, seperated by newlines. This let’s us check if a cell
just contains `#| div end`, which means that the div that was started
earlier should stop.

``` python
    div_ = cell.directives_["div"]
```

Any directives (comments in any cell marked with `#|`) will exist in the
`directives_` attribute as a dictionary. For our particular processor we
only care about the [`div`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/qmd.html#div)
directive

``` python
    if "end" in div_:
        # If it is, just fill the text with `:::` if no code exists there
        cell.source = ":::" if len(code) == 1 else f'{code.source}:::'
    else:
        # Actually modify the code
        cell.source = _LAYOUT_STR.substitute(layout=" ".join(div_), content=content)
        if not is_multicell: cell.source += ":::"
```

From there this last part checks whether to add the ending `:::` block
to the cell or to use the `_LAYOUT_STR` and inject the boilerplate div
CSS code in for Quarto.

Let’s see it in action:

``` python
cell = mk_cell(
    """#| div margin-column
Here is something for the sidebar!""",
    cell_type="markdown"
)
```

`nbdev` will pull out those directives and store them in the cell’s
`directives_` attribute using the
[`extract_directives`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#extract_directives)
function:

``` python
cell.directives_ = extract_directives(cell, "#")
cell.directives_
```

    {'div': ['margin-column']}

And now we can test out if our `convert_layout` function works!

``` python
convert_layout(cell)
print(cell.source)
```

    ::: {.margin-column}
    Here is something for the sidebar!
    :::

> Note: I print the `cell.source` here so that it’s text looks cleaner
> and what we would visually see in a `Markdown` cell

Looks exactly like we wanted earlier! Great!

How do we tell nbdev to use this and create this
[`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor) class
mentioned earlier?

### Writing a [`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor)

The second-to-last step here is to create the custom
[`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor) nbdev
utilizes to apply procs (things that modify the contents of cells). The
basic understanding of these is simply that you should create a class,
have it inherit
[`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor), and any
modifications that should be done must be defined in a `cell` function
which takes in a `cell` and modifies it in-place.

``` python
class LayoutProc(Processor):
    "A processor that will turn `div` based tags into proper quarto ones"
    has_multiple_cells = False
    def cell(self, cell):
        if cell.cell_type == "markdown" and "div" in cell.directives_:
            div_ = cell.directives_["div"]
            if self.has_multiple_cells and "end" in div_:
                convert_layout(cell)
            else:
                is_start = div_[-1] == "start"
                if is_start:
                    self.has_multiple_cells = True
                    div_.remove("start")
                convert_layout(cell, is_start)
```

How can we test if this will work or not?

A minimal Jupyter Notebook is just a dictionary where the cells are in a
`cells` key and the cells themselves are a list of notebook cells
following a special format. We’ve created one of these above. `nbdev`
has a `dict2nb` function which let’s us convert this minimal idea of a
Jupyter Notebook into the true thing quickly.

Afterwards, we can apply the processor to those cells though the
[`NBProcessor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#nbprocessor)
class (what `nbdev` uses to apply these)

``` python
from nbdev.process import NBProcessor, dict2nb
```

``` python
nb = {
    "cells":[
    mk_cell("""#| div column-margin
A test""", "markdown"),
    mk_cell("""#| div column-margin start
A test""", "markdown"),
    mk_cell("""#| div end""", "markdown"),
]}
```

<div class="column-margin">

The `mk_cell` function will create a cell based on some `content` and a
`cell type`. The particular extension we’ve built works off `Markdown`
cells, so we set the type as `markdown`.

</div>

The [`NBProcessor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#nbprocessor)
takes in a list of procs (processors) that should be applied, and an
opened Jupyter Notebook:

``` python
processor = NBProcessor(procs=LayoutProc, nb=dict2nb(nb))
```

The act of applying these processors is done through calling the
`.process():` function

``` python
processor.process()
```

And now we can see that those code cells were changed:

``` python
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Before:\n{nb['cells'][i].source}\n")
    print(f"After:\n{processor.nb.cells[i].source}\n")
```

    Before:
    #| div column-margin
    A test

    After:
    ::: {.column-margin}
    A test
    :::

    Before:
    #| div column-margin start
    A test

    After:
    ::: {.column-margin}
    A test


    Before:
    #| div end

    After:
    :::

Great! We’ve successfully created a plugin for nbdev that will let us
lazily write markdown quarto directives easily. How can we actually
*use* this in our projects?

### How to enable the plugin on your project

This requires adding a `doc_procs` key to `[tool.nbdev]` in your
`pyproject.toml`.

For example, if this were code that lived in `nbdev`, we can specify
where the processor comes from:

``` toml
[tool.nbdev]
doc_procs = ["nbdev.extensions:LayoutProc"]
```

It follows the format of `library.module:ProcessorClass`

If this were being used from an external library (such as how this
processor is based on the one that lives in
[nbdev-extensions](https://muellerzr.github.io/nbdev-extensions)), you
should add that to the dependencies of your project:

``` toml
[project]
dependencies = ["nbdev-extensions"]
```

And you’re done! Now when calling `nbdev-docs` or `nbdev-preview` the
processor we just made will be *automatically* applied to your notebooks
and perform this conversion!

### Conclusion

Basically if there’s any part of a cell and how it should look either
from exporting modules, building documentation, or creating your own
special command to perform post-processing it can be done quickly and
efficiently with this
[`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor) class
nbdev provides!

Zachary Mueller has written a library dedicated to it called
[nbdev-extensions](https://muellerzr.github.io/nbdev-extensions) where
any ideas that may benefit how I approach nbdev I then turn into an
extension for the world to use.</doc><doc title="nbdev1 Migration" desc="How to change your nbdev1 repo to work with nbdev2"># nbdev1 Migration



## 🛑**Jan 2026 Major Version Update – Breaking Change**🛑

**nbdev3 is here!** As many of you have been requesting, configuration
has moved from `settings.ini` to `pyproject.toml`, following modern
Python packaging standards ([PEP
621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)). Your project metadata now
lives in the standard `[project]` section, while nbdev-specific settings
go in `[tool.nbdev]`.

**Migrating from nbdev2:** Run `nbdev-migrate-config` in your project
root to automatically convert your `settings.ini` to `pyproject.toml`
and update your GitHub Actions workflows to use nbdev3-compatible
versions. Your existing notebooks and code don’t need any changes.

**Status of this document:** The rest of this doc describes migration
from the *very* old nbdev1 to nbdev2, and is not likely to be relevant
to most folks who haven’t been frozen in tundra for the last few years.

## Nbdev2 - Initial setup

nbdev v2 is a new from-scratch rewrite of nbdev that’s not backwards
compatible. This page describes the changes you need to make to upgrade
your nbdev v1 repo to work with the new version. The steps shown here
should work on macOS or Linux (including Windows WSL)

The biggest change is that nbdev2 uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
generate your website, whereas nbdev1 used nbconvert and jekyll. You can
use all of Quarto’s features directly in nbdev, so checkout the Quarto
website to see all the amazing functionality it supports.

If you’ve pinned nbdev in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (e.g
`nbdev<2`) remove the version pin. (*If you don’t know what this means,
then you don’t have it, so you can ignore this step*).

Install the latest version of nbdev by typing:

    pip install -U nbdev

or:

    conda install -c fastai nbdev

You may need to restart your terminal for the new commands to be visible
to your shell.

## Upgrade directives

nbdev has slightly changed how “directive comments” like `export` and
`default_exp` work, in order to align with how Quarto does things. Now,
instead of just adding a `#` to the start to indicate a directive (e.g
`#export`), you now need to use `#|` (e.g `#| export`). You can also
optionally add a space (e.g `#| export`).

To automatically upgrade your directives to the new format, run in the
root of your repo:

    nbdev-migrate

You should now test that you can export your module by running:

    nbdev-export

Note that `nbdev-export` replaces `nbdev_build_lib`. Run
`nbdev-export -h` to see the options you can pass to it (normally you
won’t need to pass any). To see a list of all the commands available in
nbdev2, run `nbdev-help`.

## Add and remove files

First set a variable with the name of your library, by running the
following (replacing “yourlib” with the name of your library’s
subdirectory)

    export LIBNAME=yourlib

Now run the following:

``` bash
git rm Makefile
git add $LIBNAME/_modidx.py
rm -rf docs
rm -f .gitconfig 
rm -f .git/hooks/post-merge

rm -f setup.py
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastai/nbdev3-template/master/styles.css
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastai/nbdev3-template/master/setup.py

cat >>.gitignore <<EOF
_docs/
_proc/
EOF
```

As you see above, we’ve remove the Makefile – that’s because all the
things done by `make` before are now handled by `nbdev` commands
directly.

<div>

> **Note**
>
> All documentation related files should be included in your `nbs_path`,
> and all paths should be relative to it. If you have set the `nbs_path`
> in your `pyproject.toml`, then copy your `styles.css` file inside of
> your `nbs_path` folder.

</div>

If you use GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI) you can update
this to use nbdev too as follows:

``` bash
rm -f .github/workflows/main.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastai/nbdev3-template/master/.github/workflows/test.yaml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastai/nbdev3-template/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml
mv deploy.yaml test.yaml .github/workflows/
```

## Update directive names

A number of directives have changed names. We’ll use `perl` to fix them.
Run these lines in the root of your repo:

``` bash
find . -name '*.ipynb' -exec perl -pi -e 's/#\|\s*hide_input/#| echo: false/' {} +
find . -name '*.ipynb' -exec perl -pi -e 's/#\|\s*hide_output/#| output: false/' {} +
find . -name '*.ipynb' -exec perl -pi -e 's/#\|\s*skip/#| eval: false/' {} +
find . -name '*.ipynb' -exec perl -pi -e 's/from nbdev.export import notebook2script/from nbdev import nbdev_export/' {} +
find . -name '*.ipynb' -exec perl -pi -e 's/notebook2script/nbdev_export/' {} +
```

These change the following directives to use functionality built into
Quarto:

- `hide_input` –\> `echo: false`
- `hide_output` –\> `output: false`
- `skip` –\> `eval: false`

They also update the new location and name of the
[`nbdev_export`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/doclinks.html#nbdev_export)
python function.

If you have any notebooks that you’ve asked nbdev1 to skip (using
`all_slow`), you’ll need to add a [raw
cell](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html#yaml-front-matter)
to the top of your notebook containing YAML frontmatter. The frontmatter
needs to include `skip_showdoc: true` to avoid running cells when
rendering docs, and `skip_exec: true` to skip this notebook when running
tests. E.g to do both, you would add a raw cell (or update your existing
frontmatter raw cell) to contain:

    ---
    skip_showdoc: true
    skip_exec: true
    ---

Or you can also add these flags in a markdown cell,

``` md
# title
> description

- skip_showdoc: true
- skip_exec: true
```

## Edit Workflow Permissions

Make sure your workflow permissions are set to “Read and write
permissions”, which you can find in Settings → Actions → General →
Workflow permissions:

<img
src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1483922/191905974-b9621c01-67ad-4ec3-bfe9-8beec9dbf8fb.png"
alt="GitHub Pages settings" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">GitHub Pages settings</figcaption>
</figure>

<div>

> **Important**
>
> Failure to set the correct permissions may result in an error message
> like this:
>
>      fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/user/repo.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
>       Error: Action failed with "The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128"

</div>

## Edit GitHub Pages Permissions

At this point you will want to commit the files with the changes you
made to GitHub. Wait for GitHub Actions to run and pass. A new branch in
your repo will automatically be created called `gh-pages`. You want to
enable GitHub Pages to work off this branch by configuring your Pages to
settings to look like this:

Access this screen under Settings → Pages

- Select “Deploy from a branch” in the drop down list for Source.
- Specify `gh-pages` as the branch
- Specify the `/root` as the location
- Click save

<figure>
<img

alt="Actions workflow permissions" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Actions workflow permissions</figcaption>
</figure>

## Final steps

You should now edit `pyproject.toml`, and change `doc_path` from `docs`
to `_docs` in `[tool.nbdev]`, since that’s where nbdev2 will build your
website.

If you use a custom domain for your website, you should move your
`CNAME` file into the directory containing your notebooks.

Before pushing to GitHub, check that your website looks OK locally by
running:

    nbdev-preview

Now prepare to commit to GitHub:

    nbdev-prepare

You can now commit to GitHub as usual. Finally, update Github Pages by
clicking on the Settings tab in your repo, then click Pages on the left
side bar. Set “Source” to gh-pages branch and the /root folder.</doc><doc title="nbdev.config" desc="Configuring nbdev and bootstrapping notebook export"># config



## Configuring nbdev

nbdev is heavily customizeable, thanks to the configuration system
defined in this module. There are 2 ways to interact with nbdev’s
config:

- **In the terminal:** `nbdev-create-config` creates a `pyproject.toml`
  (if you’re starting a new project use `nbdev-new` instead)
- **In your library:**
  [`get_config`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/config.html#get_config)
  returns a
  [`ConfigToml`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/config.html#configtoml)
  object.

Read on for more about how these work.

):

```

*Create a pyproject.toml config file.*

You can create a `pyproject.toml` by passing settings via the command
line:

``` sh
nbdev-create-config --repo nbdev --user fastai --author fastai \
                    --author_email info@fast.ai --description 'A test project'
```

If you don’t provide settings, we’ll try to infer them from git and
GitHub.

`cfg` is a
[`ConfigToml`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/config.html#configtoml) object
(inherits from `AttrDict`), so you can access keys as attributes:

``` python
p = Path.cwd().parent.parent
test_eq(cfg.lib_name, 'nbdev')
test_eq(cfg.git_url, 'https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev')
```

Its own path and parent are attributes too:

``` python
test_eq(cfg.config_path, p)
test_eq(cfg.config_file, p/'pyproject.toml')
```

Paths are relative to the project:

``` python
test_eq(cfg.doc_path, p/'_docs')
test_eq(cfg.lib_path, p/'nbdev')
test_eq(cfg.nbs_path, p/'nbs')
```

Note: If no `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.nbdev]` is found,
[`get_config()`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/config.html#get_config)
returns a minimal config with defaults based on the current directory.
Use [`is_nbdev()`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/config.html#is_nbdev) to
check if you’re in an nbdev project.

You can customize nbdev for all your projects by creating a
`~/.config/nbdev/config.toml` file (or following the [XDG
specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)).
For example, you could globally disable nbdev’s Jupyter hooks with
`jupyter_hooks = false`.

``` python

def ModuleMaker(

*Helper class to create exported library from notebook source cells*

In order to export a notebook, we need an way to create a Python file.
[`ModuleMaker`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/maker.html#modulemaker) fills
that role. Pass in the directory where you want to module created, the
name of the module, the path of the notebook source, and set `is_new` to
`True` if this is a new file being created (rather than an existing file
being added to). The location of the saved module will be in `fname`.
Finally, if the source in the notebooks should not be parsed by Python
(such as partial class declarations in cells), `parse` should be set to
`False`.

> Note: If doing so, then the `__all__` generation will be turned off as
> well.

``` python
mm = ModuleMaker(dest='tmp', name='test.testing', nb_path=Path.cwd()/'04_export.ipynb', is_new=True)
mm.fname
```

``` python
nb = make_code_cells("from __future__ import print_function", "def a():...", "def b():...",
                      "c=d=1", "_f=1", "_g=1", "_h=1", "_all_=['_g', _h]", "@patch\ndef h(self:ca):...")

### ModuleMaker.make

``` python

def make(
    cells, all_cells:NoneType=None, lib_path:NoneType=None
):

```

*Write module containing `cells` with `__all__` generated from
`all_cells`*

``` python
cells = make_code_cells("from __future__ import print_function",
                        "#| export\ndef a(): ...", "def b(): ...")
mm.make(cells, L([cells[2]]))
show_src(Path('tmp/test/testing.py').read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
```

``` python
# AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! File to edit: ../../04_export.ipynb.

# %% ../../04_export.ipynb #73b66309
from __future__ import print_function

# %% auto #0
__all__ = ['b']

# %% ../../04_export.ipynb #c168485a
#| export
def a(): ...

# %% ../../04_export.ipynb #94c4db18
def b(): ...
```

Pass `all_cells=[]` or `parse=False` if you don’t want any `__all__`
added.

Passing `parse=False` is also handy for when writing broken up functions
or classes that
[`ast.parse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.parse)
might not like but still want it to be exported, such as having a cell
with:

``` python
#| export
class A:
```

Note that by doing so we cannot properly generate a `__all__`, so we
assume that it is unwanted.

``` python
am = ModuleMaker(dest='tmp', name='test.testing_noall', nb_path=Path.cwd()/'01_export.ipynb', is_new=True, parse=False)
am.fname
```

    Path('tmp/test/testing_noall.py')

``` python
cells = make_code_cells("from __future__ import print_function", "#| export\ndef a(): ...", "#| export\nclass A:")
am.make(cells)
show_src(Path('tmp/test/testing_noall.py').read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
```

``` python
# AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! File to edit: ../../01_export.ipynb.

# %% ../../01_export.ipynb #cfd87ddf

# %% ../../01_export.ipynb #23244dea
#| export
def a(): ...

# %% ../../01_export.ipynb #c710d552
#| export
class A:
```

If `is_new=False` then the additional definitions are added to the
bottom, and any existing `__all__` is updated with the newly-added
symbols.

``` python
c2 = make_code_cells("def c(): ...", "def d(): ...")
mm = ModuleMaker(dest='tmp', name='test.testing', nb_path=Path.cwd()/'04_export.ipynb', is_new=False)
mm.make(c2, c2)

``` python

def NBProcessor(
    path:NoneType=None, procs:NoneType=None, nb:NoneType=None, debug:bool=False, rm_directives:bool=True,
    process:bool=False
):

```

*Process cells and nbdev comments in a notebook*

Cell processors can be callables (e.g regular functions), in which case
they are called for every cell (set a cell’s source to `None` to remove
the cell):

``` python
everything_fn = '../../tests/01_everything.ipynb'

def print_execs(cell):
    if 'exec' in cell.source: print(cell.source)

NBProcessor(everything_fn, print_execs).process()
```

    ---
    title: Foo
    execute:
      echo: false
    ---
    exec("o_y=1")
    exec("p_y=1")
    _all_ = [o_y, 'p_y']

Comment directives are put in a cell attribute `directive_` as a
dictionary keyed by directive name:

``` python
def printme_func(cell):
    if cell.directives_ and 'printme' in cell.directives_: print(cell.directives_['printme'])

NBProcessor(everything_fn, printme_func).process()
```

    ['testing']

However, a more convenient way to handle comment directives is to use a
*class* as a processor, and include a method in your class with the same
name as your directive, surrounded by underscores:

``` python
class _PrintExample:
    def _printme_(self, cell, to_print): print(to_print)

NBProcessor(everything_fn, _PrintExample()).process()
```

    testing

In the case that your processor supports just one comment directive, you
can just use a regular function, with the same name as your directive,
but with an underscore appended – here `printme_` is identical to
`_PrintExample` above:

``` python
def printme_(cell, to_print): print(to_print)

NBProcessor(everything_fn, printme_).process()
```

    testing

``` python
NBProcessor(everything_fn, _PrintExample()).process()
```

### Processor

``` python

def Processor(
    nb
):

```

*Base class for processors*

For more complex behavior, inherit from
[`Processor`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/process.html#processor), and
override one of more of `begin()` (called before any cells are
processed), `cell()` (called for each cell), and `end()` (called after
all cells are processed). You can also include comment directives (such
as the `_printme` example above) in these subclasses. Subclasses will
automatically have access to `self.nb`, containing the processed
notebook.

``` python
class CountCellProcessor(Processor):
    def begin(self):
        print(f"First cell:\n{self.nb.cells[0].source}")
        self.count=0
    def cell(self, cell):
        if cell.cell_type=='code': self.count += 1
    def end(self): print(f"* There were {self.count} code cells")
```

``` python
NBProcessor(everything_fn, CountCellProcessor).process()
```

    args:VAR_POSITIONAL, kwargs:VAR_KEYWORD
):

```

*A processor which exports code to a module*

Specify `dest` where the module(s) will be exported to, and optionally a
class to use to create the module
([`ModuleMaker`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/maker.html#modulemaker), by
default).

Exported cells are stored in a `dict` called `modules`, where the keys
are the modules exported to. Those without an explicit module are stored
in the `'#'` key, which will be exported to `default_exp`.

``` python
everything_fn = '../../tests/01_everything.ipynb'

exp = ExportModuleProc()
proc = NBProcessor(everything_fn, exp)
proc.process()
test_eq(exp.default_exp, 'everything')
assert 'print_function'  in exp.modules['#'][1].source
assert 'h_n' in exp.in_all['some.thing'][0].source
```

### nb_export

``` python

def nb_export(
    nbname:str, # Filename of notebook
    lib_path:str=None, # Path to destination library.  If not in a nbdev project, defaults to current directory.
    procs:NoneType=None, # Processors to use
    name:str=None, # Name of python script {name}.py to create.
    mod_maker:type=ModuleMaker, debug:bool=False, # Debug mode
    solo_nb:bool=False, # Export single notebook outside of an nbdev project.
):

```

*Create module(s) from notebook*

Let’s check we can import a test file:

``` python
shutil.rmtree('tmp', ignore_errors=True)
nb_export('../../tests/00_some.thing.ipynb', 'tmp')

g = exec_new('import tmp.some.thing')
test_eq(g['tmp'].some.thing.__all__, ['a'])
test_eq(g['tmp'].some.thing.a, 1)
```

We’ll also check that our ‘everything’ file exports correctly:

``` python
nb_export(everything_fn, 'tmp')

g = exec_new('import tmp.everything; from tmp.everything import *')
_alls = L("a b d e m n o p q".split())
for s in _alls.map("{}_y"): assert s in g, s
for s in "c_y_nall _f_y_nall g_n h_n i_n j_n k_n l_n".split(): assert s not in g, s
for s in _alls.map("{}_y") + ["c_y_nall", "_f_y_nall"]: assert hasattr(g['tmp'].everything,s), s
```

That notebook should also export one extra function to `tmp.some.thing`:

``` python
del(sys.modules['tmp.some.thing']) # remove from module cache
g = exec_new('import tmp.some.thing')
test_eq(g['tmp'].some.thing.__all__, ['a','h_n'])
test_eq(g['tmp'].some.thing.h_n(), None)
```

``` python
Path('../nbdev/export.py').unlink(missing_ok=True)
nb_export('04_export.ipynb')

g = exec_new('import nbdev.export')
assert hasattr(g['nbdev'].export, 'nb_export')

``` python
c.doc('nbdev.doclinks.NbdevLookup')

    'https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/doclinks.html#nbdevlookup'

Symbol names are taken from libraries registered using the ‘nbdev’ entry
point. By default, all libraries with this entry point are searched, but
full symbol names (including module prefix) are required.

``` python
assert c.doc('numpy.array').startswith('http')
assert not c.doc('numpy.Array')
assert c.doc('NbdevLookup').endswith('#nbdevlookup')
assert not c.doc('array')
```

Pass `strip_libs` to list libraries which should be available without
requiring a module prefix.

``` python
c = NbdevLookup(strip_libs=('nbdev', 'nbdev_numpy'))
assert c.doc('array').startswith('http')
```

``` python

def linkify(
    md
):

```

```` python
md = """This is a link to `numpy.array` and to `array()` and to `get_config()` but not a link to `foobar`.
And not a link to <code>dict2nb</code>.

    This is not a link to `get_config`

```
This isn't a link to `get_config` either
```"""
````

``` python
print(NbdevLookup(('nbdev','numpy')).linkify(md))
```

    This is a link to [`numpy.array`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html#numpy.array) and to `array()` and to [`get_config()`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/config.html#get_config) but not a link to `foobar`.
    And not a link to <code>dict2nb</code>.

        This is not a link to `get_config`

    ```
    This isn't a link to `get_config` either
    ```

``` python
# Test code blocks
md = """```python
def foo():
    return `bar`
```"""
assert NbdevLookup().linkify(md) == md
```

``` python
# Test builtins
md = "`builtins.str.split`"
NbdevLookup().linkify(md)
```

    '[`builtins.str.split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split)'

``` python
# ... now with stripping
md = "`str.split` and `str`"
NbdevLookup('nbdev_stdlib').linkify(md)
```

    '[`str.split`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) and [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)'

When there is a conflict, the linkification will apply in the order of
the stripped libraries and then by alphabetical order. For example,
`enumerate` is both a builtin and a function in the threading module.
However, since builtins comes first alphabetically, it will take
priority

``` python
md = "`enumerate`, `builtins.enumerate` and `threading.enumerate`"
NbdevLookup(('nbdev_stdlib')).linkify(md)
```

    '[`enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate), [`builtins.enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) and [`threading.enumerate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.enumerate)'

We can also take the `find()` function as another instance, it exists as
a standard library and in numpy. Therefore, depending on the order of
stripped libraries we pass, `find()` will link to either numpy or
standard library.

``` python
md = "`find()`"
NbdevLookup(('nbdev_numpy','nbdev_stdlib')).linkify(md)
```

    '[`find()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.char.find.html#numpy.char.find)'

``` python
md = "`find()`"
NbdevLookup(('nbdev_stdlib','nbdev_numpy')).linkify(md)
```

    '[`find()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#gettext.find)'

You can also use NbdevLookup with import aliases like the following:

``` python
import numpy as np
```

``` python
NbdevLookup(ns=globals()).linkify('this is an aliased import link `np.array`')
```

    'this is an aliased import link [`np.array`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html#numpy.array)'</doc><doc title="nbdev.sync" desc="Propagate small changes in the library back to notebooks"># sync



The library is primarily developed in notebooks so any big changes
should be made there. But sometimes, it’s easier to fix small bugs or
typos in the modules directly. `nbdev-update` is the command that will
propagate those changes back to the corresponding notebooks.

Note that you can’t create new cells or reorder cells with that
functionality, so your corrections should remain limited. Exported `.py`
files must contain cell IDs (format `# %% path/nb.ipynb #cell_id`); if
your exports don’t have IDs, run `nbdev-export` to regenerate them.

## Introduction

When working with jupyter notebooks (which are json files behind the
scenes) and GitHub, it is very common that a merge conflict (that will
add new lines in the notebook source file) will break some notebooks you
are working on. This module defines the function `nbdev-fix` to fix
those notebooks for you, and attempt to automatically merge standard
conflicts. The remaining ones will be delimited by markdown cells like
this:

`<<<<<< HEAD`

``` python
# local code here
```

`======`

``` python
# remote code here
```

`>>>>>> a7ec1b0bfb8e23b05fd0a2e6cafcb41cd0fb1c35`

Below is an example of broken notebook. The json format is broken by the
lines automatically added by git. Such a file can’t be opened in jupyter
notebook.

``` python
broken = Path('../../tests/example.ipynb.broken')
tst_nb = broken.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
print(tst_nb)
```

    {
     "cells": [
      {
       "cell_type": "code",
       "execution_count": 6,
       "metadata": {},
       "outputs": [
        {
         "data": {
          "text/plain": [
           "3"
          ]
         },
         "execution_count": 6,
         "metadata": {},
         "output_type": "execute_result"
        }
       ],
       "source": [
    <<<<<<< HEAD
        "z=3\n",
    =======
        "z=2\n",
    >>>>>>> a7ec1b0bfb8e23b05fd0a2e6cafcb41cd0fb1c35
        "z"
       ]
      },
      {
       "cell_type": "code",
       "execution_count": 7,
       "execution_count": 5,
       "metadata": {},
       "outputs": [
        {
         "data": {
          "text/plain": [
           "6"
          ]
         },
    <<<<<<< HEAD
         "execution_count": 7,
    =======
         "execution_count": 5,
    >>>>>>> a7ec1b0bfb8e23b05fd0a2e6cafcb41cd0fb1c35
         "metadata": {},
         "output_type": "execute_result"
        }
       ],
       "source": [
        "x=3\n",
        "y=3\n",
        "x+y"
       ]
      },
      {
       "cell_type": "code",
       "execution_count": null,
       "metadata": {},
       "outputs": [],
       "source": []
      }
     ],
     "metadata": {
      "kernelspec": {
       "display_name": "Python 3",
       "language": "python",
       "name": "python3"
      }
     },
     "nbformat": 4,
     "nbformat_minor": 2
    }

Note that in this example, the second conflict is easily solved: it just
concerns the execution count of the second cell and can be solved by
choosing either option without really impacting your notebook. This is
the kind of conflict we will fix automatically. The first conflict is
more complicated as it spans across two cells and there is a cell
present in one version, not the other. Such a conflict (and generally
the ones where the inputs of the cells change form one version to the
other) aren’t automatically fixed, but we will return a proper json file
where the annotations introduced by git will be placed in markdown
cells.

## Creating a merged notebook

The approach we use is to first “unpatch” the conflicted file,
regenerating the two files it was originally created from. Then we redo
the diff process, but using cells instead of text lines.

### unpatch

``` python

def unpatch(
    s:str
):

```

*Takes a string with conflict markers and returns the two original
files, and their branch names*

The result of “unpatching” our conflicted test notebook is the two
original notebooks it would have been created from. Each of these
original notebooks will contain valid JSON:

``` python
a,b,branch1,branch2 = unpatch(tst_nb)
dict2nb(loads(a))
```

``` python

### nbdev_fix

``` python

def nbdev_fix(
    nbname:str, # Notebook filename to fix
    outname:str=None, # Filename of output notebook (defaults to `nbname`)
    nobackup:bool_arg=True, # Do not backup `nbname` to `nbname`.bak if `outname` not provided
    theirs:bool=False, # Use their outputs and metadata instead of ours
    noprint:bool=False, # Do not print info about whether conflicts are found
):

```

*Create working notebook from conflicted notebook `nbname`*

This begins by optionally backing the notebook `fname` to `fname.bak` in
case something goes wrong. Then it parses the broken json, solving
conflicts in cells. Every conflict that only involves metadata or
outputs of cells will be solved automatically by using the local
(`theirs==False`) or the remote (`theirs==True`) branch. Otherwise, or
for conflicts involving the inputs of cells, the json will be repaired
by including the two version of the conflicted cell(s) with markdown
cells indicating the conflicts. You will be able to open the notebook
again and search for the conflicts (look for `<<<<<<<`) then fix them as
you wish.

A message will be printed indicating whether the notebook was fully
merged or if conflicts remain.

``` python
nbdev_fix(broken, outname='tmp.ipynb')
chk = read_nb('tmp.ipynb')
test_eq(len(chk.cells), 7)
os.unlink('tmp.ipynb')
```

    One or more conflict remains in the notebook, please inspect manually.

### nbdev_merge

``` python

def nbdev_merge(
    base:str, ours:str, theirs:str, path:str
):

```

*Git merge driver for notebooks*

This implements a [git merge
driver](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_defining_a_custom_merge_driver)
for notebooks that automatically resolves conflicting metadata and
outputs, and splits remaining conflicts as separate cells so that the
notebook can be viewed and fixed in Jupyter. The easiest way to install
it is by running `nbdev-install-hooks`.

This works by first running Git’s default merge driver, and then
`nbdev-fix` if there are still conflicts. You can set `nbdev-fix`’s
`theirs` argument using the `THEIRS` environment variable, for example:

    THEIRS=True git merge branch</doc><doc title="nbdev.showdoc" desc="Display symbol documentation in notebook and website"># showdoc



## Documentation For An Object

Render the signature as well as the `docments` to show complete
documentation for an object.

``` python

def show_doc(

    renderer:NoneType=None, # Optional renderer (defaults to markdown)
    name:str | None=None, # Optionally override displayed name of `sym`
    title_level:int=3, # Heading level to use for symbol name
):

```

*Show signature and docstring for `sym`*

You can use
[`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc) to
document apis of functions, classes or methods.

### Numpy Docstrings

if you have [numpy
docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
instead of `docments`,
[`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc) will
attempt to parse and render those just like `docments`.

<div>

> **Warning**
>
> Numpy docstring formatting is very strict. If your docstrings do not
> strictly adhere to the numpy format, it will not be parsed properly
> and information about parameters and return values may not properly be
> rendered in the table below the signature. Where possible, we
> recommend using `docments` to annonate your function instead.

</div>

## show_doc on Classes

[`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/showdoc.html#show_doc) works on
Classes, too, including when you use `@patch`.

You can define methods for the class `Foo` with `@patch` which is
convenient in allowing you to break up code for documentation in
notebooks.

Class properties also work with showdoc.

### FrontmatterProc

``` python

def FrontmatterProc(
    nb
):

```

*A YAML and formatted-markdown frontmatter processor*

YAML frontmatter can be added to notebooks in one of two ways:

1.  By adding a raw notebook cell with `---` as the first and last
    lines, and YAML between them, or
2.  A specially formatted markdown cell. The first line should be start
    with a single `#` (creating an H1 heading), and becomes the title.
    Then, optionally, a line beginning with `>` (creating a quote
    block), which becomes the description. Finally, zero or more lines
    beginning with `-` (creating a list), each of which contains YAML.
    (If you already have “title” defined in frontmatter in a raw cell,
    then markdown cells will be ignored.)

For instance, our test notebook contains the following markdown cell:

    # a title
    > A description
    - key1: value1
    - key2: value2
    - categories: [c1, c2]

It also contains the following raw cell:

    ---
    execute:
      echo: false
    ---

When we process with
[`FrontmatterProc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/frontmatter.html#frontmatterproc),
these will both be removed, and a single raw cell will be added to the
top, containing the combined YAML frontmatter:

``` python
nbp = NBProcessor(_test_file, procs=FrontmatterProc)
nbp.process()
print(nbp.nb.cells[0].source)
```

    ---
    categories:
    - c1
    - c2
    description: A description
    execute:
      echo: false
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
    output-file: docs_test.html
    title: a title

    ---

In addition, a `frontmatter_` attr will be added to the notebook,
containing this information as a `dict`:

``` python
d = nbp.nb.frontmatter_
d
```

    {'execute': {'echo': False},
     'title': 'a title',
     'description': 'A description',
     'key1': 'value1',
     'key2': 'value2',
     'categories': ['c1', 'c2'],
     'output-file': 'docs_test.html'}</doc><doc title="nbdev.processor" desc="Some processors for NBProcessor"># processors



On this page we’ll be using this private helper to process a notebook
and return the results, to simplify testing:

``` python
def _run_procs(procs=None, return_nb=False, path=_test_file):
    nbp = NBProcessor(path, procs)
    nbp.process()
    if return_nb: return nbp.nb
    return '\n'.join([str(cell) for cell in nbp.nb.cells])

To avoid pointless conflicts while working with jupyter notebooks (with
different execution counts or cell metadata), it is recommended to clean
the notebooks before committing anything (done automatically if you
install the git hooks with `nbdev-install-hooks`). The following
functions are used to do that. Cleaning also adds cell `id`s if missing
(required by nbformat 4.5+).

## Trust

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a
href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev/blob/main/nbdev/clean.py#L25"
target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller">source</a>

### nbdev_trust

``` python

def nbdev_trust(
    fname:str=None, # A notebook name or glob to trust
    force_all:bool=False, # Also trust notebooks that haven't changed
):

```

*Trust notebooks matching `fname`.*

## Clean

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a
href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev/blob/main/nbdev/clean.py#L87"
target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller">source</a>

### clean_nb

``` python

def clean_nb(
    nb, # The notebook to clean
    clear_all:bool=False, # Remove all cell metadata and cell outputs?
    allowed_metadata_keys:list=None, # Preserve the list of keys in the main notebook metadata
    allowed_cell_metadata_keys:list=None, # Preserve the list of keys in cell level metadata
    clean_ids:bool=True, # Remove ids from plaintext reprs?
):

```

*Clean `nb` from superfluous metadata*

Jupyter adds a trailing <code></code> to images in cell outputs.
Vscode-jupyter does not.  
Notebooks should be brought to a common style to avoid unnecessary
diffs:

``` python
test_nb = read_nb('../../tests/image.ipynb')
assert test_nb.cells[0].outputs[0].data['image/png'][-1] == "\n" # Make sure it was not converted by acccident
clean_nb(test_nb)
assert test_nb.cells[0].outputs[0].data['image/png'][-1] != "\n"
```

The test notebook has metadata in both the main metadata section and
contains cell level metadata in the second cell:

``` python
test_nb = read_nb('../../tests/metadata.ipynb')

assert {'meta', 'jekyll', 'my_extra_key', 'my_removed_key'} <= test_nb.metadata.keys()
assert {'meta', 'hide_input', 'my_extra_cell_key', 'my_removed_cell_key'} == test_nb.cells[1].metadata.keys()
```

After cleaning the notebook, all extra metadata is removed, only some
keys are allowed by default:

``` python
clean_nb(test_nb)

assert {'jekyll', 'kernelspec'} == test_nb.metadata.keys()
assert {'hide_input'} == test_nb.cells[1].metadata.keys()
```

We can preserve some additional keys at the notebook or cell levels:

``` python
test_nb = read_nb('../../tests/metadata.ipynb')
clean_nb(test_nb, allowed_metadata_keys={'my_extra_key'}, allowed_cell_metadata_keys={'my_extra_cell_key'})

assert {'jekyll', 'kernelspec', 'my_extra_key'} == test_nb.metadata.keys()
assert {'hide_input', 'my_extra_cell_key'} == test_nb.cells[1].metadata.keys()
```

Passing `clear_all=True` removes everything from the cell metadata:

``` python
test_nb = read_nb('../../tests/metadata.ipynb')
clean_nb(test_nb, clear_all=True)

assert {'jekyll', 'kernelspec'} == test_nb.metadata.keys()
test_eq(test_nb.cells[1].metadata, {})
```

Passing `clean_ids=True` removes `id`s from plaintext repr outputs, to
avoid notebooks whose contents change on each run since they often lead
to git merge conflicts. For example:

    <PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=L size=28x28 at 0x7FB4F8979690>

becomes:

    <PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=L size=28x28>

### nbdev_clean

``` python

def nbdev_clean(
    fname:str=None, # A notebook name or glob to clean
    clear_all:bool=False, # Remove all cell metadata and cell outputs?
    disp:bool=False, # Print the cleaned outputs
    stdin:bool=False, # Read notebook from input stream
):

```

*Clean all notebooks in `fname` to avoid merge conflicts*

By default (`fname` left to `None`), all the notebooks in
`config.nbs_path` are cleaned. You can opt in to fully clean the
notebook by removing every bit of metadata and the cell outputs by
passing `clear_all=True`.

If you want to keep some keys in the main notebook metadata you can set
`allowed_metadata_keys` in `[tool.nbdev]` in `pyproject.toml`. Similarly
for cell level metadata use: `allowed_cell_metadata_keys`. For example,
to preserve both `k1` and `k2` at both the notebook and cell level add
the following to `pyproject.toml`:

``` toml
[tool.nbdev]
allowed_metadata_keys = ["k1", "k2"]
allowed_cell_metadata_keys = ["k1", "k2"]
```

### clean_jupyter

``` python

def clean_jupyter(
    path, model, kwargs:VAR_KEYWORD
):

```

*Clean Jupyter `model` pre save to `path`*

This cleans notebooks on-save to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts. The
easiest way to install it for both Jupyter Notebook and Lab is by
running `nbdev-install-hooks`. It works by implementing a
`pre_save_hook` from Jupyter’s [file save hook
API](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/savehooks.html).

## Hooks

### nbdev_install_hooks

``` python

def nbdev_install_hooks(
    
):

```

*Install Jupyter and git hooks to automatically clean, trust, and fix
merge conflicts in notebooks*

See
[`clean_jupyter`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/clean.html#clean_jupyter)
and `nbdev-merge` for more about how each hook works.</doc><doc title="nbdev.test" desc="Run unit tests on notebooks in parallel"># test

### test_nb

``` python

def test_nb(
    fn, # file name of notebook to test
    skip_flags:NoneType=None, # list of flags marking cells to skip
    force_flags:NoneType=None, # list of flags marking cells to always run
    do_print:bool=False, # print completion?
    showerr:bool=True, # print errors to stderr?
    basepath:NoneType=None, # path to add to sys.path
    verbose:bool=False, # stream stdout/stderr from cells to console?
    save:bool=False, # write outputs back to notebook on success?
):

```

*Execute tests in notebook in `fn` except those with `skip_flags`*

[`test_nb`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/test.html#test_nb) can test a
notebook, and skip over certain flags:

``` python
_nb = Path('../../tests/directives.ipynb')
success,duration = test_nb(_nb, skip_flags=['notest'])
assert success
```

In that notebook the cell flagged *notest* raises an exception, which
will be returned as a `bool`:

``` python
_nb = Path('../../tests/directives.ipynb')
success,duration = test_nb(_nb, showerr=False)
assert not success
```

Sometimes you may wish to override one or more of the skip_flags, in
which case you can use the argument `force_flags` which will remove the
appropriate tag(s) from `skip_flags`. This is useful because
`skip_flags` are meant to be set in the `tst_flags` field of
`[tool.nbdev]` in `pyproject.toml`, whereas `force_flags` are usually
passed in by the user.

    do_print:bool=False, # Print start and end of each notebook
    pause:float=0.01, # Pause time (in seconds) between notebooks to avoid race conditions
    ignore_fname:str='.notest', # Filename that will result in siblings being ignored
    verbose:bool=False, # Print stdout/stderr from notebook cells?
    save:bool=False, # Write outputs back to notebooks on success?
    symlinks:bool=False, # Follow symlinks?
    file_glob:str='*.ipynb', # Only include files matching glob
    file_re:str=None, # Only include files matching regex
    folder_re:str=None, # Only enter folders matching regex
    skip_file_glob:str=None, # Skip files matching glob
    skip_file_re:str='^[_.]', # Skip files matching regex
    skip_folder_re:str='^[_.]', # Skip folders matching regex
):

```

*Test in parallel notebooks matching `path`, passing along `flags`*

``` python
nbdev_test(n_workers=0)
```

    Success.

You can even run `nbdev-test` in non nbdev projects, for example, you
can test an individual notebook like so:

    nbdev-test --path ../../tests/minimal.ipynb --do_print

Or you can test an entire directory of notebooks filtered for only those
that match a regular expression:

    nbdev-test --path ../../tests --file_re '.*test.ipynb' --do_print</doc><doc title="nbdev.cli" desc="CLI commands"># cli

*Make fastpages front matter in markdown files quarto compliant.*

Here is what the front matter of a fastpages markdown post looks like
before migration:

### Directives

nbdev v2 directives start with a `#|` whereas v1 directives were
comments without a pipe `|`.

``` python
_test_dir = """
#default_exp
 #export
# collapse-show
#collapse-hide
#collapse
# collapse_output
not_dir='#export'
# hide_input
foo
# hide
"""
test_eq(_repl_directives(_test_dir),
"""
#| default_exp
#| export
#| code-fold: show
#| code-fold: true
#| code-fold: true
# collapse_output
not_dir='#export'
#| echo: false
foo
#| include: false
""")
```

target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller">source</a>

### \_repl_v1dir

``` python

def _repl_v1dir(
    cell
):

```

*Replace nbdev v1 with v2 directives.*

for example, if any of the lines below are valid nbdev v1 directives,
they replaced with a `#|`, but only before the first line of code:

### Callouts

In fastpages, there was a markdown shortuct for callouts for `Note`,
`Tip`, `Important` and `Warning` with block quotes (these only worked in
notebooks). Since Quarto has its own [callout
blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html#callout-types)
with markdown syntax, we do not implement these shortcuts in nbdev.
Instead, we offer a manual conversion utility for these callouts so that
you can migrate from fastpages to Quarto.

<a
href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/nbdev/blob/main/nbdev/migrate.py#L134"
target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller">source</a>

### \_convert_callout

``` python

def _convert_callout(
    s
):

```

*Convert nbdev v1 to v2 callouts.*

For example, the below markdown:

``` python
_callouts="""
## Boxes / Callouts

> Warning: There will be no second warning!

Other text

> Important: Pay attention! It's important.

> Tip: This is my tip.

> Note: Take note of `this.`
"""
```

Gets converted to:


    ## Boxes / Callouts

    :::{.callout-warning}

    There will be no second warning!

    :::

    Other text

    :::{.callout-important}

    Pay attention! It's important.

    :::

### Video Embeds

In fastpages, you could embed videos with a simple markdown shortcut
involving a block quote with the prefix `youtube:`, that looked like
this

`> youtube: https://youtu.be/XfoYk_Z5AkI`

However, in Quarto you can use the [video
extension](https://github.com/quarto-ext/video) to embed videos.

## Overview

`nbdev.release` provides 3 commands that you can run from your shell to
manage your changelog file and git releases:

- `nbdev-changelog`: creates a CHANGELOG.md file from closed and labeled
  GitHub issues
- `nbdev-release-git`: tags and creates a release in GitHub for the
  current version
- `nbdev-release-gh`: calls `nbdev-changelog`, lets you edit the result,
  then pushes to git and calls `nbdev-release-git`

It provides 3 futher commands for releasing packages on pypi or conda:

- `nbdev-pypi`: Create and upload a pypi installer
- `nbdev-conda`: Create and upload a conda installer
- `nbdev-release-both`: Create and upload both pypi and conda installers

Here’s a brief demonstration of how to use the changelog and git release
tools in `nbdev.release`. This demo first creates an issue using the
[`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) command line tool, and then closes it
using `git`; you can also use GitHub’s web interface for both of these
tasks. (Note that this functionality used to be in a project called
`fastrelease`, so in the video the command line tools have different
names, starting with `fastrelease_` instead of `nbdev-`).

[<img src="images/release.svg" width="900" />](images/release.svg)

### Setup

You’ll need to get a GitHub [personal access
token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
if you haven’t already. To do so, [click
here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and enter “nbdev” in the
“Note” section, and click the `repo` checkbox.

Then click “Generate Token” at the bottom of the screen, and copy the
token (the long string of letters and numbers shown). You can easily do
that by clicking the little clipboard icon next to the token.

<img alt="Copying your token" width="743" caption="Copying your token" src="images/token.png">

It’s easiest to save the token as an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`
that can be automatically accessed. We recommend you do this is by
adding the following to the end of your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

``` bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=xxx
```

…and then replace the `xxx` with the token you just copied. It will
automatically be avaialble whenever you start a new shell (but don’t
forget to `source` that file or open a new shell after you change it.).

### Creating release notes

Now you’re ready to create your release notes. These are created in a
file called `CHANGELOG.md`. Here’s an example of what it creates: [nbdev
CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

All issues with the label **bug**, **enhancement**, or **breaking** that
have been closed in your repo since your last release will be added to
the top of this file. If you haven’t made any releases before, then all
issues with those labels will be included.

Therefore, before you create or update `CHANGELOG.md`, go to your GitHub
issues page, remove `is:open` from the filter, and label any issues you
want included with one of the labels above. When you’ve done that, you
can create or update your release notes by running in your terminal:

    nbdev_changelog

The titles and bodies of each issue will be added. Open `CHANGELOG.md`
in your editor and make any edits that you want, and then commit the
file to your repo (remember to `git add` it!)

### Tagging a release

You should now tag a release. This will create a tag in GitHub with your
current version number in `__init__.py`, and will then make it into a
release, using your latest release notes as the description of the
release:

    nbdev_release_git

After you run this, be sure to increment your version number. You can
either edit it manually, or if you use nbdev it can be done for you by
running:

    nbdev_bump_version

### Doing both (creating release notes, and tagging a release)

To complete both of the steps above, run:

    nbdev_release_gh

See the screencast above for a demonstration of this.

## Python API

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a

target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller">source</a>

### Release

``` python

def Release(
    owner:NoneType=None, repo:NoneType=None, token:NoneType=None, groups:VAR_KEYWORD
):

```

*Create CHANGELOG.md from GitHub issues*

To create a markdown changelog, first create a
[`Release`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/release.html#release) object,
optionally passing a mapping from GitHub labels to markdown titles. Put
your github token in a file named `token` at the root of your repo.
[`Release`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/release.html#release) attempts to
fetch values for arguments from the following locations if not supplied:

- **owner:** fetched from the GitHub URL in `[project.urls]` in
  `pyproject.toml`. This is the owner name of the repository on GitHub.
  For example for the repo `fastai/fastcore` the owner would be
  `fastai`.
- **repo:** fetched from the field `name` in `[project]` in
  `pyproject.toml`. This is the name of the repository on GitHub. For
  example for the repo `fastai/fastcore` the repo would be `fastcore`.
- **token:** fetched from a file named `token` at the root of your repo.
  Creating a token is discussed in [the
  setup](https://fastrelease.fast.ai/#Set-up) section.
- **groups:** (optional) fetched from the field `label_groups` in
  `[tool.nbdev]` in `pyproject.toml`. This is a mapping from label names
  to titles in your release notes. If not specified, this defaults to:

``` python
{"breaking": "Breaking Changes", "enhancement":"New Features", "bug":"Bugs Squashed"}
```

### release_conda

``` python

def release_conda(
    path:str='conda', # Path where package will be created
    do_build:bool_arg=True, # Run `conda build` step
    build_args:str='', # Additional args (as str) to send to `conda build`
    skip_upload:store_true=False, # Skip `anaconda upload` step
    mambabuild:store_true=False, # Use `mambabuild` (requires `boa`)
    upload_user:str=None, # Optional user to upload package to
):

```

*Create a `meta.yaml` file ready to be built into a package, and
optionally build and upload it*

### chk_conda_rel

``` python

def chk_conda_rel(
    nm:str, # Package name on pypi
    apkg:str=None, # Anaconda Package (defaults to {nm})
    channel:str='fastai', # Anaconda Channel
    force:store_true=False, # Always return github tag
):

```

*Prints GitHub tag only if a newer release exists on Pypi compared to an
Anaconda Repo.*

To build and upload a conda package, cd to the root of your repo, and
then:

    nbdev-conda-package

Or to do things more manually:

    nbdev-conda-package --do_build false
    cd conda
    conda build --no-anaconda-upload --output-folder build {name}
    anaconda upload build/noarch/{name}-{ver}-*.tar.bz2

Add `--debug` to the `conda build command` to debug any problems that
occur. Note that the build step takes a few minutes. Add `-u {org_name}`
to the `anaconda upload` command if you wish to upload to an
organization, or pass `upload_user` to `nbdev-conda-package`.

**NB**: you need to first of all upload your package to PyPi, before
creating the conda package.

### release_pypi

``` python

def release_pypi(
    repository:str='pypi', # Respository to upload to (defined in ~/.pypirc)
    quiet:bool=False, # Reduce output verbosity
):

```

*Create and upload Python package to PyPI*

Use `--repository` flag to upload to [TestPypi](https://test.pypi.org/)
(e.g. `nbdev-pypi --repository testpypi`) and custom/private
repositories.

The
[~/.pypirc](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/)
file can be updated to configure the additional repositories, see
example below:

``` toml
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi
    private-repository

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = <PyPI token>

[testpypi]
username = __token__
password = <TestPyPI token>

[private-repository]
repository = <private-repository URL>
username = <private-repository username>
password = <private-repository password>
```

Use `nbdev-pypi --repository private-repository` to upload to the
private repository.

### release_both

``` python

def release_both(
    path:str='conda', # Path where package will be created
    do_build:bool_arg=True, # Run `conda build` step
    build_args:str='', # Additional args (as str) to send to `conda build`
    skip_upload:store_true=False, # Skip `anaconda upload` step
    mambabuild:store_true=False, # Use `mambabuild` (requires `boa`)
    upload_user:str=None, # Optional user to upload package to
    repository:str='pypi', # Pypi respository to upload to (defined in ~/.pypirc)
):

```

*Release both conda and PyPI packages*

### nbdev_bump_version

``` python

def nbdev_bump_version(
    part:int=2, # Part of version to bump
    unbump:bool=False, # Reduce version instead of increasing it
):

```

*Increment version in **init**.py by one*</doc></optional></project>
